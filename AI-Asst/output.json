Based on our clinical experience, we believe that this adjustment could greatly decrease the risk of right ventricular perforation and major pericardial effusion due to the procedure. Conclusions AF-related stroke is a major problem and is sometimes challenging to prevent. Warfarin therapy significantly reduces the risk of stroke. Fewer than 50% of patients who are at risk for AF-related stroke are prescribed Warfarin or fill a prescription for it because of patient preferences or relative or absolute contraindications. At times when Warfarin should be stopped, for example for surgery or during significant bleeding events, patients with AF are at significant risk of having a thromboembolic event. In addition, randomized clinical trials have shown that only around 60% of serial international normalized ratio (INR) measurements in patients who use Warfarin are within the therapeutic range.18 Furthermore, Warfarin use is inconvenient for patients because it requires conitnuous INR monitoring and dose adjustments and because there can be a wide range of drug interactions."],"content_type":["text"],"embedding":{},"id":["b0d59110a1f09c25747366c620c66e42"],"meta":{"_split_id":[17],"device":["Lariat"],"name":["Review_of_LARIAT_Suture_Delivery.pdf"],"page":[4]},"score":[0.7505]},{"content":["The minimally invasive strategies for occluding the LAA ostium include implantation of a foreign body (such as the WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure Device) and pericardial suture ligation of the LAA base. The acceptable acute success rate of the LAA closure with the LARIAT device (> 90%) and the relatively low rate of complications associated with this procedure suggest that LAA ligation with the LARIAT device may be a reasonable option for preventing strokes in patients who have contraindications to OAC therapy. The main difficulty in performing the LARIAT procedure is the need for simultaneous transseptal and pericardial access, which increases the risk of pericardial effusion and bleeding. In addition, the use of the LARIAT device can be limited by anatomic variables such as an LAA diameter > 40 mm, a posteriorly rotated LAA, or pericardial adhesions from prior cardiac surgery or pericarditis. Although the LARIAT procedure has not been shown to be superior to other LAA closure techniques, it could be a desirable choice when there is an absolute contraindication to OAC therapy.

Although newer oral anticoagulants overcome many of these difficulties, all anticoagulants increase the risk of bleeding and cannot be used in patients who are at high risk for bleeding events.

Although the device was successfully deployed in 95% of cases, 24 patients had cardiac perforation during pericardial access, and 34 patients had pericarditis following implantation. These types of extremely serious complications and others such as complete LAA detachment from the heart led the FDA to issue a safety alert in July 2015.

However use of these agents is associated with increased risk for bleeding and is not suitable for those with contraindications to oral anticoagulation. Surgical LAA exclusion was commonly done during Cox-Maze procedure and mitral valve surgery. Progressively newer and less invasive techniques have been developed for LAA exclusion. LARIAT is a novel, minimally invasive endo-epicardial LAA exclusion technique and in this review article we discuss the rationale for LAA exclusion, LARIAT technique and its advantages compared to other LAA exclusion strategies. LAA Morphology and Functions The LAA is a remnant of the primitive left atrium, which is formed during the 3rd week of gestation. The LAA is a long tubular, often multi-lobed and trabeculated structure, which opens into the left atrium by means of an ostium between the left superior pulmonary vein and the mitral annulus.6 Morphologically, the LAA can be classified into 4 different types based on its external appearance: 1.

Study Limitations A limitation of the study is the single-arm nature, using a method of epicardial LAAC with the LARIAT device. This does not allow for generalization to other methods of epicardial LAAC or comparison with endocardial LAAC procedures. The main objective of the study was to see how the RAAS system and hormone levels are changed during the follow-up period after LAA closure therapy. However, the lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure observed in this study at the 1- and 2-year follow-up period is only a consequence of lower RAAS and adrenergic activity. Nevertheless, our study provides a trend in neurohormonal biomarkers after epicardial LAA ligation with the LARIAT device that can be further investigated and explored in larger clinical trials that are already underway. Biomarker changes also did not correlate with clinical outcomes, hospital readmissions, mortality, and healthcare cost utilisation in patients with long-standing persistent AF who underwent percutaneous epicardial LAA ligation.
