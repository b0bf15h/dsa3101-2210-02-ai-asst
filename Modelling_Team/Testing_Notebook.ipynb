      "[<Document: {'content': \"Alternative to Blood Thinners\\nTake a short survey to see if an implant could be\\nthe right stroke-risk reduction option for you\\nStart Here\\nThere are different treatments available to reduce your stroke risk if you have AFib. The most common are blood\\nthinners. Learn about blood thinner alternatives below.\\nIs There an Alternative to Blood Thinners?\\nBlood thinner medications, also called anticoagulant drugs, are an effective way to lower the risk of stroke in\\npeople with atrial fibrillation, or AFib, not caused by a heart valve problem.\\nThe blood thinner warfarin (also known as Coumadin®) has been around for more than 60 years. There are also\\nseveral newer blood thinners available now, including Eliquis® (apixaban), Pradaxa® (dabigatran),\\nXarelto® (rivaroxaban), and Savaysa® (edoxaban).\\nFor people who need an alternative, there are heart procedures that can effectively reduce the risk of stroke.\\nWATCHMAN is a permanent implant that does just that.\\nLearn more about who WATCHMAN is for\\nBlood Thinner Medications and AFib Stroke Risk\\n1\\n2\\nLike blood thinners, WATCHMAN can effectively reduce stroke\\nrisk. This permanent implant is for people with AFib not\\ncaused by a heart valve problem who need an alternative.\\nWATCHMAN or Blood Thinners?\\n2\\nOver a 1/3 of people with AFib feel trapped between the fear of\\nhaving a stroke and fear of the risks associated with blood\\nthinners. In fact, more than 4 in 5 people with AFib taking a\\nblood thinner (83%) say they would be willing to try a\\ndifferent treatment to help reduce their risk of stroke.\\nBeyond Blood Thinners\\n3\\nSee if the WATCHMAN\\nImplant is right for you \\uf054\\n×\\nMENU\\x0cSee if it's right for you See What Makes WATCHMAN Different\\nWarfarin is a common blood thinner prescribed to reduce stroke risk in people with atrial fibrillation. It’s been used\\nfor decades and is typically less expensive than the newer types of blood thinners—but it comes with certain\\nrequirements and restrictions.\\nRegular blood tests: With warfarin, you have to get regular blood tests—from twice a week to once a month,\\ndepending on your doctor’s recommendation. These tests measure your INR, or International Normalized\\nRatio, a number that tells how long it takes for your blood to clot.\\nDietary guidelines: Certain foods, like leafy greens, can affect your INR if you’re taking warfarin. Forgetting\\nto take your medication can also put you out of range. If you’re outside the recommended INR, you may be\\nat higher risk for stroke or higher risk for bleeding.\\nNewer blood thinners don’t come with the same dietary restrictions as warfarin, and they don’t require INR\\ntesting. If you have trouble with your warfarin treatment plan, your cardiologist may recommend that you take a\\ndifferent type of blood thinner. While these blood thinners offer additional options to warfarin, each medication\\ncomes with its own risks and benefits.\\nWarfarin vs Other Blood Thinner Medications\\n4,5\\n1\\nBlood thinners, or anticoagulants, are very effective at reducing the risk of stroke in people with atrial fibrillation,\\nand most people can take them for years without serious side effects. But because blood thinners help prevent\\nclots by thinning the blood, they also increase the risk of bleeding.\\nMinor bleeding: Most bleeding events are minor and easily treated, like a cut taking longer than normal to\\nstop bleeding. Some people bruise more easily on blood thinners. You should discuss any of these\\nsymptoms with your doctor.\\nMajor bleeding: In other cases, bleeding can be serious and require medical help or blood transfusions.\\nSometimes, the bleeding can be life-threatening, for example, when bleeding in the brain causes a stroke.\\nWhen considering your treatment options, your cardiologist will weigh your risk of a stroke against your risk of a\\nserious bleeding problem. These risks depend on several factors—for some people the risk of bleeding is higher\\nthan for others.\\nBlood Thinner Medications and Bleeding Risks\\n1\\n1\\nBlood Thinners Come with Challenges\\nWarfarin\\nBleeding Risk That Grows Over Time\\n•\\nDaily Pills\\n•\\nContinuing to Take Medication as Prescribed\\nLong-Term\\n•\\nRegular Blood (INR) Tests\\n•\\nAll Blood Thinners\\nBleeding Risk That Grows Over Time\\n•\\nDaily or 2x/Daily Pills\\n•\\nContinuing to Take Medication as Prescribed\\nLong-Term\\n•\\nComplicates Surgical Procedures\\n•\\nSee if the WATCHMAN\\nImplant is right for you \\uf054\\n×\\x0cFood and Drug Interaction Issues\\n•\\nComplicates Surgical Procedures\\n•\\nHigh Ongoing Cost\\n•\\nPatient Ambassadors are a community of people that have\\nreceived the WATCHMAN implant and have volunteered to\\nshare their personal experiences with potential patients.\\nSpeak to one of our Education Specialists to learn more\\nCall 1-844-355-9114\\nHear from a WATCHMAN Patient\\nWATCHMAN Educational Specialists are trained professionals\\nwith healthcare experience.

Other\\nAFib patients choose not to take blood thinners due to side effects or for\\nother reasons.\\nLeft atrial appendage closure: A procedure called left atrial\\nappendage closure provides an alternative to blood thinners for\\npeople who need one. The left atrial appendage is a small pouch\\nat the top of the heart. When a blood clot escapes from the left\\natrial appendage and travels to another part of the body, it can cut\\noff the blood supply to the brain, causing a stroke. In people with\\nAFib not caused by a heart valve problem, more than 90% of\\nstroke-causing clots that come from the heart are formed in the\\nleft atrial appendage (LAA). Closing off the LAA is an effective way\\nto reduce stroke risk in these people.\\nThe WATCHMAN Implant is a left atrial appendage closure\\nprocedure. It is the most implanted, FDA-approved device proven\\nto reduce stroke risk in people with atrial fibrillation not caused by\\na heart valve problem (also referred to as non-valvular AFib).\\nLearn more about the WATCHMAN procedure ►\\nIt’s important to understand that a stroke can be caused by factors other\\nthan a clot escaping from the left atrial appendage. These causes can\\ninclude high blood pressure and the narrowing of blood vessels to the\\nbrain. Left atrial appendage closure will not prevent these other causes\\nof stroke.\\nIf You Can’t Take a Blood Thinner Long Term\\n1\\n6\\n7\\nSee if the WATCHMAN\\nImplant is right for you \\uf054\\n×\\x0cWATCHMAN is a one-time, minimally invasive procedure that\\npermanently reduces the risk of stroke and bleeding worry.\\nLearn more about WATCHMAN as an alternative to blood thinners ►\\nScience always looks for ways to make effective treatments even better.\\nWATCHMAN is no exception. The WATCHMAN FLX design is an\\nadvancement that enables the implant to fit a greater number of\\npatients. giving more people than ever a safe, effective alternative to\\nblood thinners should they need one.\\nIn a clinical trial, 96% of people were able to stop taking blood thinners\\njust 45 days after the WATCHMAN FLX procedure.\\nThis can mean a lower risk of bleeding from long-term blood thinner\\nuse. After getting WATCHMAN and stopping their blood thinner,\\npatients take aspirin and clopidogrel (Plavix®) for 6 months. After that,\\nthey take only aspirin on an ongoing basis.\\nHow Is WATCHMAN an Alternative to Blood Thinners?\\n8\\n9\\nIt’s important to understand that, like blood thinners, WATCHMAN does not cure AFib.

It's the\\nWATCHMAN Implant\\nAnswer a few short questions to see if you may\\nbe a candidate\\nStart Here\\nThe WATCHMAN Implant is a one-time, minimally invasive procedure for people with atrial fibrillation not caused\\nby a heart valve problem (also known as non-valvular AFib) who need an alternative to blood thinners.\\nNon-valvular Afib can mean a lifetime of blood thinners. It can also mean a lifetime of worry about issues like\\nbleeds and falls. More than 200,000 people have left blood thinners behind with the WATCHMAN Implant.\\nThe WATCHMAN Implant Difference\\nSee How the WATCHMAN Implant Works\\nSee why the WATCHMAN Implant reduces stroke risk and how the\\nprocedure is done.\\nTo understand how the WATCHMAN Implant works, it helps to know more about\\nthe connection between atrial fibrillation and stroke.\\nHow the WATCHMAN Implant Works\\n03:42\\nSee if the WATCHMAN\\nImplant is right for you \\uf054\\n×\\nMENU\\x0cAtrial fibrillation, or AFib, affects your heart’s ability to pump blood normally. This\\ncan cause blood to pool in an area of the heart called the left atrial appendage, or\\nLAA. There, blood cells can stick together and form a clot. When a blood clot\\nescapes from the LAA and travels to another part of the body, it can cut off the\\nblood supply to the brain, causing a stroke.\\nIn people with AFib not caused by a heart valve problem, more than 90% of\\nstroke-causing clots that come from the heart are formed in the LAA. That’s why\\nclosing off this part of the heart is an effective way to reduce stroke risk.\\nThe WATCHMAN Implant fits right into your LAA. It’s designed to permanently\\nclose it off and keep those blood clots from escaping. The WATCHMAN Implant is\\nabout the size of a quarter and made from very light and compact materials\\ncommonly used in many other medical implants.\\n1,2\\n1\\nScience always looks for ways to make effective treatments even better. The\\nWATCHMAN Implant is no exception. The WATCHMAN FLX Implant design is an\\nadvancement that enables the implant to fit a greater number of patients, giving\\nmore people than ever a safe, effective alternative to blood thinners should they\\nneed one.\\nIn a clinical trial, 96% of people were able to stop taking blood thinners just 45\\ndays after the WATCHMAN Implant procedure.3\\nThe WATCHMAN Implant is placed into your heart in a one-time procedure. It’s a permanent device that doesn’t\\nhave to be replaced and can’t be seen outside the body.\\nTo place the WATCHMAN Implant, your doctor makes a small cut in your upper leg and inserts a narrow tube. Your\\ndoctor then guides the WATCHMAN Implant into the left atrial appendage (LAA) of your heart. The procedure is\\ndone under general anesthesia and takes as little as 30 minutes. Patients commonly stay in the hospital for a day\\nor less.\\nThe WATCHMAN Implant Procedure\\nDue to the risk of having a medical procedure, patients should not be considered for the WATCHMAN Implant if\\nthey are doing well and expect to continue doing well on blood thinners.\\nSee if the WATCHMAN\\nImplant is right for you \\uf054\\n×\\x0cAnswer a few short questions to see if you may be a candidate\\nand get a customized guide to help you start a conversation\\nwith your doctor\\nGet Started\\nCould the WATCHMAN Implant be right\\nfor you?\\nWATCHMAN Educational Specialists are trained professionals\\nwith healthcare experience.

During this time,\\nheart tissue will grow over the implant to form a barrier against blood\\nclots. Your doctor will monitor this process by taking pictures of your\\nheart to see when you can stop taking your blood thinner.\\nYour doctor will then prescribe a medicine called clopidogrel (also\\nknown as Plavix®) and aspirin for you to take for 6 months. After that,\\nyou’ll continue to take aspirin on an ongoing basis.

It’s been used\\nfor decades and is typically less expensive than the newer types of blood thinners—but it comes with certain\\nrequirements and restrictions.\\nRegular blood tests: With warfarin, you have to get regular blood tests—from twice a week to once a month,\\ndepending on your doctor’s recommendation. These tests measure your INR, or International Normalized\\nRatio, a number that tells how long it takes for your blood to clot.\\nDietary guidelines: Certain foods, like leafy greens, can affect your INR if you’re taking warfarin. Forgetting\\nto take your medication can also put you out of range. If you’re outside the recommended INR, you may be\\nat higher risk for stroke or higher risk for bleeding.\\nNewer blood thinners don’t come with the same dietary restrictions as warfarin, and they don’t require INR\\ntesting. If you have trouble with your warfarin treatment plan, your cardiologist may recommend that you take a\\ndifferent type of blood thinner. While these blood thinners offer additional options to warfarin, each medication\\ncomes with its own risks and benefits.\\nWarfarin vs Other Blood Thinner Medications\\n4,5\\n1\\nBlood thinners, or anticoagulants, are very effective at reducing the risk of stroke in people with atrial fibrillation,\\nand most people can take them for years without serious side effects. But because blood thinners help prevent\\nclots by thinning the blood, they also increase the risk of bleeding.\\nMinor bleeding: Most bleeding events are minor and easily treated, like a cut taking longer than normal to\\nstop bleeding. Some people bruise more easily on blood thinners. You should discuss any of these\\nsymptoms with your doctor.\\nMajor bleeding: In other cases, bleeding can be serious and require medical help or blood transfusions.\\nSometimes, the bleeding can be life-threatening, for example, when bleeding in the brain causes a stroke.\\nWhen considering your treatment options, your cardiologist will weigh your risk of a stroke against your risk of a\\nserious bleeding problem. These risks depend on several factors—for some people the risk of bleeding is higher\\nthan for others.\\nBlood Thinner Medications and Bleeding Risks\\n1\\n1\\nBlood Thinners Come with Challenges\\nWarfarin\\nBleeding Risk That Grows Over Time\\n•\\nDaily Pills\\n•\\nContinuing to Take Medication as Prescribed\\nLong-Term\\n•\\nRegular Blood (INR) Tests\\n•\\nAll Blood Thinners\\nBleeding Risk That Grows Over Time\\n•\\nDaily or 2x/Daily Pills\\n•\\nContinuing to Take Medication as Prescribed\\nLong-Term\\n•\\nComplicates Surgical Procedures\\n•\\nSee if the WATCHMAN\\nImplant is right for you \\uf054\\n×\\x0cFood and Drug Interaction Issues\\n•\\nComplicates Surgical Procedures\\n•\\nHigh Ongoing Cost\\n•\\nPatient Ambassadors are a community of people that have\\nreceived the WATCHMAN implant and have volunteered to\\nshare their personal experiences with potential patients.\\nSpeak to one of our Education Specialists to learn more\\nCall 1-844-355-9114\\nHear from a WATCHMAN Patient\\nWATCHMAN Educational Specialists are trained professionals\\nwith healthcare experience.

Other\\nAFib patients choose not to take blood thinners due to side effects or for\\nother reasons.\\nLeft atrial appendage closure: A procedure called left atrial\\nappendage closure provides an alternative to blood thinners for\\npeople who need one. The left atrial appendage is a small pouch\\nat the top of the heart. When a blood clot escapes from the left\\natrial appendage and travels to another part of the body, it can cut\\noff the blood supply to the brain, causing a stroke. In people with\\nAFib not caused by a heart valve problem, more than 90% of\\nstroke-causing clots that come from the heart are formed in the\\nleft atrial appendage (LAA). Closing off the LAA is an effective way\\nto reduce stroke risk in these people.\\nThe WATCHMAN Implant is a left atrial appendage closure\\nprocedure. It is the most implanted, FDA-approved device proven\\nto reduce stroke risk in people with atrial fibrillation not caused by\\na heart valve problem (also referred to as non-valvular AFib).\\nLearn more about the WATCHMAN procedure ►\\nIt’s important to understand that a stroke can be caused by factors other\\nthan a clot escaping from the left atrial appendage. These causes can\\ninclude high blood pressure and the narrowing of blood vessels to the\\nbrain. Left atrial appendage closure will not prevent these other causes\\nof stroke.\\nIf You Can’t Take a Blood Thinner Long Term\\n1\\n6\\n7\\nSee if the WATCHMAN\\nImplant is right for you \\uf054\\n×\\x0cWATCHMAN is a one-time, minimally invasive procedure that\\npermanently reduces the risk of stroke and bleeding worry.\\nLearn more about WATCHMAN as an alternative to blood thinners ►\\nScience always looks for ways to make effective treatments even better.\\nWATCHMAN is no exception.
