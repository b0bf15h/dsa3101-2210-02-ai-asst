Bergmann, MD, eBoris Schmidt, MD, fand Jacqueline Saw, MD, FRCPC gRochester, Minneapolis, MN;New York, NY; Stanford, CA; Hamburg, Frankfurt, Germany; and British Columbia, CanadaBackground Oral anticoagulants (OACs) reduce stroke risks with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF); however, they areunderused because of absolute or relative contraindications due to real or perceived risk of bleeding. Although left atrialappendage closure is increasingly performed in OAC-ineligible patients, this has not been studied in a randomizedcontrolled trial.Study objectives The ASAP-TOO study is designed to establish the safety and effectiveness of the Watchman leftatrial appendage closure device in patients with nonvalvular AF who are deemed ineligible for OAC. The primary effectivenessend point is the time to first occurrence of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism. The primary safety end point includes all-causedeath, ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, or device- or procedural-related event requiring open cardiac surgery or majorendovascular intervention.Study design This is a multinational, multicenter prospective randomized trial.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'name': '1-s2.0-S0002870317300881-main.pdf', '_split_id': 0}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'c32c1e73108ab7a3943c85555ae2b213'}>, <Document: {'content': 'The primary safety end point includes all-causedeath, ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, or device- or procedural-related event requiring open cardiac surgery or majorendovascular intervention.Study design This is a multinational, multicenter prospective randomized trial. Patients meeting the inclusion criteriawith CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 2 and who are deemed by 2 study physicians to be unsuitable for OAC will be randomized in a2:1 allocation ratio to Watchman versus control. Control patients will be prescribed single antiplatelet therapy or no therapy atthe discretion of the study physician. Up to 888 randomized subjects will be enrolled from up to 100 global investigationalsites. Both device group and control patients will have follow-up visits at 3, 6, and 12 months and then every 6 months through60 months.Summary This trial will assess the safety and efficacy of Watchman in this challenging population of high–stroke risk AFpatients.

As populations age with increasing morbid-ity, the incidence increases.1The relationship betweenincreasing age, AF, and stroke is well documented. AF isassociated with a 5-fold increase in stroke rates, and thesecardioembolic events are typically associated withmarked increases in both mortality and morbidity.2-4The pathophysiology of stroke in the setting of non-valvular AF has been well studied in pathologic andechocardiographic studies and has been confirmed in therandomized controlled Watchman Left Atrial AppendageSystem for Embolic Protection in Patients with AtrialFibrillation (PROTECT-AF) study with left atrial append-age closure (LAAC), which documented equivalentreduction in stroke with Watchman LAAC comparedwith warfarin. The field continues to evolve basedprimarily on the introduction and increasing applicationof non–vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) and thesubsequent approval of LAAC with the Watchman device.The former has been documented in multiple random-ized trials to be superior to conventional warfarin therapyfor reduction of hemorrhagic stroke, with attenuatedreduction in all-cause stroke as well as a reduction inischemic stroke.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'name': '1-s2.0-S0002870317300881-main.pdf', '_split_id': 2}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '9bd7c9bad30236a8360cb8ab0f36fc77'}>]\n"
