Reddy, MD, b Maurice Buchbinder, MD, c Kenneth Stein, MD, d Myriah Elletson d Martin W. Bergmann, MD, e Boris Schmidt, MD, f and Jacqueline Saw, MD, FRCPC g Rochester, Minneapolis, MN; New York, NY; Stanford, CA; Hamburg, Frankfurt, Germany; and British Columbia, Canada Background Oral anticoagulants (OACs) reduce stroke risks with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF); however, they are underused because of absolute or relative contraindications due to real or perceived risk of bleeding. Although left atrial appendage closure is increasingly performed in OAC-ineligible patients, this has not been studied in a randomized controlled trial. Study objectives The ASAP-TOO study is designed to establish the safety and effectiveness of the Watchman left atrial appendage closure device in patients with nonvalvular AF who are deemed ineligible for OAC. The primary effectiveness end point is the time to first occurrence of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism. The primary safety end point includes all-cause death, ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, or device- or procedural-related event requiring open cardiac surgery or major endovascular intervention. Study design This is a multinational, multicenter prospective randomized trial.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'name': '1-s2.0-S0002870317300881-main.pdf', '_split_id': 0}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '59ad37fd36a378797ad7321a4f351e7'}>, <Document: {'content': 'The primary safety end point includes all-cause death, ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, or device- or procedural-related event requiring open cardiac surgery or major endovascular intervention. Study design This is a multinational, multicenter prospective randomized trial. Patients meeting the inclusion criteria with CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 2 and who are deemed by 2 study physicians to be unsuitable for OAC will be randomized in a 2:1 allocation ratio to Watchman versus control. Control patients will be prescribed single antiplatelet therapy or no therapy at the discretion of the study physician. Up to 888 randomized subjects will be enrolled from up to 100 global investigational sites. Both device group and control patients will have follow-up visits at 3, 6, and 12 months and then every 6 months through 60 months. Summary This trial will assess the safety and efficacy of Watchman in this challenging population of high–stroke risk AF patients. (Am Heart J 2017;189:68-74.) Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia both in the United States and worldwide.

As populations age with increasing morbid- ity, the incidence increases.1 The relationship between increasing age, AF, and stroke is well documented. AF is associated with a 5-fold increase in stroke rates, and these cardioembolic events are typically associated with marked increases in both mortality and morbidity.2-4 The pathophysiology of stroke in the setting of non- valvular AF has been well studied in pathologic and echocardiographic studies and has been confirmed in the randomized controlled Watchman Left Atrial Appendage System for Embolic Protection in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation (PROTECT-AF) study with left atrial append- age closure (LAAC), which documented equivalent reduction in stroke with Watchman LAAC compared with warfarin. The field continues to evolve based primarily on the introduction and increasing application of non–vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) and the subsequent approval of LAAC with the Watchman device. The former has been documented in multiple random- ized trials to be superior to conventional warfarin therapy for reduction of hemorrhagic stroke, with attenuated reduction in all-cause stroke as well as a reduction in ischemic stroke.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'name': '1-s2.0-S0002870317300881-main.pdf', '_split_id': 2}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'de05bf865a6b1af932096059b93f08dc'}>]\n"

Bergmann, MD, e Boris Schmidt, MD, f and Jacqueline Saw, MD, FRCPC g Rochester, Minneapolis, MN; New York, NY; Stanford, CA; Hamburg, Frankfurt, Germany; and British Columbia, Canada Background Oral anticoagulants (OACs) reduce stroke risks with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF); however, they are underused because of absolute or relative contraindications due to real or perceived risk of bleeding. Although left atrial appendage closure is increasingly performed in OAC-ineligible patients, this has not been studied in a randomized controlled trial. Study objectives The ASAP-TOO study is designed to establish the safety and effectiveness of the Watchman left atrial appendage closure device in patients with nonvalvular AF who are deemed ineligible for OAC. The primary effectiveness end point is the time to first occurrence of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism. The primary safety end point includes all-cause death, ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, or device- or procedural-related event requiring open cardiac surgery or major endovascular intervention. Study design This is a multinational, multicenter prospective randomized trial.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'name': '1-s2.0-S0002870317300881-main.pdf', 'device': 'Watchman', '_split_id': 0}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '59ad37fd36a378797ad7321a4f351e7'}>, <Document: {'content': 'The primary safety end point includes all-cause death, ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, or device- or procedural-related event requiring open cardiac surgery or major endovascular intervention. Study design This is a multinational, multicenter prospective randomized trial. Patients meeting the inclusion criteria with CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 2 and who are deemed by 2 study physicians to be unsuitable for OAC will be randomized in a 2:1 allocation ratio to Watchman versus control. Control patients will be prescribed single antiplatelet therapy or no therapy at the discretion of the study physician. Up to 888 randomized subjects will be enrolled from up to 100 global investigational sites. Both device group and control patients will have follow-up visits at 3, 6, and 12 months and then every 6 months through 60 months. Summary This trial will assess the safety and efficacy of Watchman in this challenging population of high–stroke risk AF patients. (Am Heart J 2017;189:68-74.)

As populations age with increasing morbid- ity, the incidence increases.1 The relationship between increasing age, AF, and stroke is well documented. AF is associated with a 5-fold increase in stroke rates, and these cardioembolic events are typically associated with marked increases in both mortality and morbidity.2-4 The pathophysiology of stroke in the setting of non- valvular AF has been well studied in pathologic and echocardiographic studies and has been confirmed in the randomized controlled Watchman Left Atrial Appendage System for Embolic Protection in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation (PROTECT-AF) study with left atrial append- age closure (LAAC), which documented equivalent reduction in stroke with Watchman LAAC compared with warfarin. The field continues to evolve based primarily on the introduction and increasing application of non–vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) and the subsequent approval of LAAC with the Watchman device. The former has been documented in multiple random- ized trials to be superior to conventional warfarin therapy for reduction of hemorrhagic stroke, with attenuated reduction in all-cause stroke as well as a reduction in ischemic stroke.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'name': '1-s2.0-S0002870317300881-main.pdf', 'device': 'Watchman', '_split_id': 2}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'de05bf865a6b1af932096059b93f08dc'}>]\n"
