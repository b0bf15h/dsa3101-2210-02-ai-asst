          "context": "Indications, Safety, & Warnings  United States (https://www.m edtronic.com/u s- en/index.html) Indications, Safety, and Warnings Resolute Onyx™ DES Indications The Resolute Onyx™ Zotarolimus-Eluting Coronary Stent System is indicated for improving coronary luminal diameters in patients, including those with diabetes mellitus or high bleeding risk, with symptomatic ischemic heart disease due to de novo lesions of length ≤ 35 mm in native coronary arteries with reference vessel diameters of 2.0 mm to 5.0 mm. In addition, the Resolute Onyx™ Zotarolimus-Eluting Coronary Stent System is indicated for treating de novo chronic total occlusions. Contraindications The Resolute Onyx™ Zotarolimus-Eluting Coronary Stent System is contraindicated for use in: Patients with a known hypersensitivity or allergies to aspirin, heparin, bivalirudin, clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor, ticlopidine, drugs such as zotarolimus, tacrolimus, sirolimus, everolimus, or similar drugs or any other analogue or derivative Patients with a known hypersensitivity to the cobalt-based alloy (cobalt, nickel, chromium, and molybdenum) or platinum-iridium alloy Patients with a known hypersensitivity to the BioLinx™ polymer or its individual components Coronary artery stenting is contraindicated for use in: Patients in whom antiplatelet and/or anticoagulation therapy is contraindicated Patients who are judged to have a lesion that prevents complete inflation of an angioplasty balloon or proper placement of the stent or stent delivery system Warnings Please ensure that the inner package has not been opened or damaged as this would indicate the sterile barrier has been breached. The use of this product carries the same risks associated with coronary artery stent implantation procedures, which include subacute and late vessel thrombosis, vascular complications, and/or bleeding events. This product should not be used in patients who are not likely to comply with the recommended antiplatelet therapy.\fPrecautions Only physicians who have received adequate training should perform implantation of the stent. Subsequent stent restenosis or occlusion may require repeat catheter-based treatments (including balloon dilatation) of the arterial segment containing the stent. The long-term outcome following repeat catheter-based treatments of previously implanted stents is not well characterized. The risks and benefits of the stent implantation should be assessed for patients with a history of severe reaction to contrast agents. Do not expose or wipe the product with organic solvents such as alcohol. The use of a drug-eluting stent (DES) outside of the labeled indications, including use in patients with more tortuous anatomy, may have an increased risk of adverse events, including stent thrombosis, stent embolization, MI, or death. Care should be taken to control the position of the guide catheter tip during stent delivery, stent deployment, and balloon withdrawal. Before withdrawing the stent delivery system, confirm complete balloon deflation using fluoroscopy to avoid arterial damage caused by guiding catheter movement into the vessel. Stent thrombosis is a low-frequency event that is frequently associated with myocardial infarction (MI) or death. Data from the RESOLUTE clinical trials have been prospectively evaluated and adjudicated using the definition developed by the Academic Research Consortium (ARC). The safety and effectiveness of the Resolute Onyx™ stent have not yet been established in the following patient populations: Patients with target lesions that were treated with prior brachytherapy or the use of brachytherapy to treat in-stent restenosis of a Resolute Onyx™ stent Women who are pregnant or lactating Men intending to father children Pediatric patients below the age of 18 years Patients with coronary artery reference vessel diameters of < 2.0 mm or > 5.0 mm Patients with evidence of an acute ST-elevation MI within 72 hours of intended stent implantation Patients with vessel thrombus at the lesion site Patients with lesions located in a saphenous vein graft, in the left main coronary artery, ostial lesions, or bifurcation lesions Patients with diffuse disease or poor flow distal to identified lesions Patients with three-vessel disease The safety and effectiveness of the Resolute Onyx™ stent have not been established in the cerebral, carotid, or peripheral vasculature. Additionally, the safety and effectiveness of using atherectomy devices with Resolute Onyx™ stent have not been established. The effect of potential drug interactions on the safety or effectiveness of the Resolute Onyx™ stent has not been investigated. Potential interactions of the Resolute Onyx™ stent with other drug-eluting or coated stents have not been evaluated and should be avoided whenever possible. Clinical studies of the Resolute™ stent did not suggest any significant differences in safety and effectiveness for male and female patients and did not include sufficient numbers of patients to assess for differences in safety and effectiveness due to ethnicity. Oral antiplatelet therapy\fDual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) using a combination treatment of aspirin with a P2Y12 platelet inhibitor after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), reduces the risk of stent thrombosis and ischemic cardiac events, but increases the risk of bleeding complications. The optimal duration of DAPT (specifically a P2Y12 platelet inhibitor in addition to aspirin) following DES implantation is unknown, and DES thrombosis may still occur despite continued therapy. It is very important that the patient is compliant with the post-procedural antiplatelet recommendations. Per 2016 ACC/AHA guidelines,1 a daily aspirin dose of 81 mg is recommended indefinitely after PCI. A P2Y12 platelet inhibitor should be given daily for at least 6 months in stable ischemic heart disease patients and for at least 12 months in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Consistent with the DAPT Study,2 and the 2016 ACC/AHA guidelines, longer duration of DAPT may be considered in patients at higher ischemic risk with lower bleeding risk. The Academic Research Consortium (ARC) proposed a standardized definition for identifying patients at high bleeding risk (HBR).3 Additionally, evidence from a dedicated study of Resolute Onyx in HBR patients and those who are unable to tolerate long term DAPT after PCI has been published.4 Based on the Onyx ONE Clear Analysis, Resolute Onyx is safe and effective in patients at high risk of bleeding treated with one month of DAPT. The patients evaluated in the Onyx ONE Clear Analysis met the pre-defined criteria for high bleeding risk and were those whom in the opinion of their physician, the potential benefit of 1-Month DAPT outweighed the potential risk. In addition to at least one HBR risk factor, enrollment included 48.6% ACS patients (unstable angina 22.8%, Non-STEMI 21.7% and STEMI 4.2%). Decisions about duration of DAPT are best made on an individual basis and should integrate clinical judgment, assessment of the benefit/risk ratio, and patient preference. Premature discontinuation or interruption of prescribed antiplatelet medication could result in a higher risk of stent thrombosis, MI, or death. Before PCI, if premature discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy is anticipated, physicians should carefully evaluate with the patient whether a DES and its associated recommended DAPT regimen is the appropriate PCI choice. Following PCI, if elective noncardiac surgery requiring suspension of antiplatelet therapy is considered, the risks and benefits of the procedure should be weighed against the possible risk associated with interruption of antiplatelet therapy. Patients who require premature DAPT discontinuation should be carefully monitored for cardiac events. At the discretion of the patient’s treating physician(s), the antiplatelet therapy should be restarted as soon as possible. Potential adverse effects\fOther risks associated with using this device are those associated with percutaneous coronary diagnostic (including angiography and IVUS) and treatment procedures. These risks (in alphabetical order) may include but are not limited to: Abrupt vessel closure Access site pain, hematoma, or hemorrhage Allergic reaction (to contrast, antiplatelet therapy, stent material, or drug and polymer coating) Aneurysm, pseudoaneurysm, or arteriovenous fistula (AVF) Arrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation Balloon rupture Bleeding Cardiac tamponade Coronary artery occlusion, perforation, rupture, or dissection Coronary artery spasm Death Embolism (air, tissue, device, or thrombus) Emergency surgery: peripheral vascular or coronary bypass Failure to deliver the stent Hemorrhage requiring transfusion Hypotension/hypertension Incomplete stent apposition Infection or fever MI Pericarditis Peripheral ischemia/peripheral nerve injury Renal failure Restenosis of the stented artery Shock/pulmonary edema Stable or unstable angina Stent deformation, collapse, or fracture Stent migration or embolization Stent misplacement Stroke/transient ischemic attack Thrombosis (acute, subacute, or late) Adverse events related to Zotarolimus Patients’ exposure to zotarolimus is directly related to the total amount of stent length implanted. The actual side effects/complications that may be associated with the use of zotarolimus are not fully known. The adverse events that have been associated with the intravenous injection of zotarolimus in humans include but are not limited to: Anemia Diarrhea Dry skin Headache Hematuria Infection Injection site reaction Pain (abdominal, arthralgia, injection site) Rash\fThe potential adverse reactions in nursing infants from zotarolimus have not been determined. The pharmacokinetic and safety profiles of zotarolimus in infants are not known. Adverse events related to BioLinx™ polymer Although the type of risks of the BioLinx™ polymer coating are expected to be no different than those of other stent coatings, the potential for these risks are currently unknown as the coating has limited previous use in humans. These risks may include but are not limited to the following: Allergic reaction Focal inflammation at the site of stent implantation Restenosis of the stented artery Please reference appropriate product Instructions for Use for more information regarding indications, contraindications, warnings, precautions, and potential adverse events.

Email: price.matthew@scrippshealth.org Funding information Medtronic, Santa Rosa, California Abstract Objectives: To assess the safety and efficacy of the novel Resolute (R-) Onyx drug-eluting stent (DES). Background: The R-Onyx DES consists of a composite wire with an outer shell of cobalt chro- mium alloy and a platinum-iridium inner core to enhance radiopacity, with thinner, swaged struts and modified stent geometry compared with the predicate Resolute DES, resulting in a slightly lower total drug load in most sizes. Methods: This was a prospective, single-arm non-inferiority trial compared with a historical con- trol. Patients with stable angina/ischemia and up to 2 de novo target lesions \u001435 mm long with reference vessel diameter (RVD) of 2.25–4.2 mm were enrolled. The primary endpoint was late lumen loss at 8-month follow-up. Propensity-score adjusted outcomes from the single-arm RESO- LUTE-US trial served as the control. Results: Seventy-five patients (85 lesions) were enrolled. Mean patient age was 66 6 9 years, 73% were male, and 32% had diabetes. Mean lesion length was 14.28 6 6.68 mm, mean RVD was 2.57 6 0.48 mm, and 86% of lesions were class B2/C. In-stent late lumen loss at 8 months was 0.24 6 0.39 mm with R-Onyx DES compared with 0.36 6 0.52 mm with Resolute DES (P < 0.001 for noninferiority, P 5 0.029 for superiority). At 8 months, clinically driven target lesion revascularization occurred in 3 patients (4.0%) and target lesion failure occurred in 5 patients (6.7%). Conclusions: In-stent late lumen loss is non-inferior, and appears to be superior, with the thin- strut novel composite wire R-Onyx DES compared with Resolute DES. Continued evolution of stent design can improve angiographic outcomes in complex lesions, even in the current era of next-generation DES.

This has led to the use of DES in increasingly complex patient and lesion Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02419521 Catheter Cardiovasc Interv. 2017;1–7. wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/ccd V C 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. | 1 Received: 2 June 2017 | Revised: 2 August 2017 | Accepted: 14 August 2017 DOI: 10.1002/ccd.27322 Catheter Cardiovasc Interv. 2018;92:253–259. wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/ccd © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. 253 1522726x, 2018, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ccd.27322 by National University Of Singapo, Wiley Online Library on [21/10/2022].

Although device success is around 97% with current-generation DES, improving device deliverability and conformability are important to ensure continued high procedural success, which also influences long- term patient outcomes. Moreover, enhanced radiopacity is important for accurate placement of stents within a lesion, especially for bifur- cated or heavily calcified lesions and overweight patients. Stent implan- tation also alters local vascular geometry and may cause vascular injury, resulting in changes in wall shear stress dependent on stent design, and can mediate cellular proliferation and neointimal hyperpla- sia [5]. Furthermore, while target lesion revascularization (TLR) with current generation DES is uncommon, clinical success is still limited by the development of in-stent restenosis, particularly in patients with significant anatomic complexity [6]. Thinner stent struts might further reduce neointimal hyperplasia and enhance post-DES outcomes. In addition, reducing stent strut thickness may help address the need for improved deliverability. Importantly, such design iteration could be unfavorable by reduc- ing radiopacity and compromising radial strength. Reduced radiopacity may increase geographic miss, and lack of radial strength can lead to recoil and underexpansion, both of which may result in adverse patient outcomes, including increased late luminal loss, repeat revasculariza- tion, and stent thrombosis. The Resolute (R-) Onyx DES (Medtronic, Santa Rosa, CA), an iteration of the Resolute DES family [7], is com- posed of a composite wire material with a platinum-iridium inner core, and an outer shell of the same cobalt chromium alloy as the predeces- sor Resolute Integrity and Resolute DES, but with a swaged shape and thinner stent struts with sustained radial strength (Figure 1). Zotaroli- mus dose density and polymer are identical between the R-Onyx, Res- olute Integrity, and Resolute DES; however, due to modified stent geometry, the overall drug load is 10–25% lower with R-Onyx DES compared with both Resolute and Resolute Integrity, with the excep- tion of the 2.75 mm size, in which the drug load is on average 10% higher. We hypothesized that the characteristics of the R-Onyx DES would safely provide similar angiographic outcomes as predicate Resolute DES. Therefore, the RESOLUTE ONYX Core trial was a multi- center, prospective study designed to compare the novel R-Onyx DES to historical control data for the Resolute DES. 2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 | Device description The R-Onyx DES uses a single continuous wire with a swaged shape that is formed into a sinusoidal design, wound around a mandrel, and laser-fused at specific crowns to create its final configuration. The outer shell of the R-Onyx DES is the same cobalt chromium alloy as the Resolute DES. The dense inner core of R-Onyx DES is an alloy of 90% platinum and 10% iridium used to enhance radiopacity (Figure 1). The strut thickness of Resolute DES and R-Onyx DES are 91 and 81 lm, respectively, for the 2.25–4.0 mm diameter sizes. R-Onyx has a swaged shape and a larger strut width-to-thickness ratio than Resolute DES to maintain radial strength despite thinner struts. Specifically, the width of R-Onyx remains 91 lm but the thickness was reduced to 81 lm. Zotarolimus dose density and polymer are identical to the Resolute DES; however, due to modified stent geometry, the overall drug load is slightly reduced in most sizes of the R-Onyx DES. 2.2 | Clinical study design The RESOLUTE ONYX Core (2.25–4.0 mm) Clinical Study was a single- arm, open-label, multicenter, noninferiority study involving 12 centers in the United States using propensity-adjusted results of the angio- graphic cohort of the RESOLUTE-US clinical trial as a historical control (Supporting Information Table S1) [8]. Eligible patients had evidence of ischemic heart disease, stable or unstable angina, and/or a positive FIGURE 1 Cross-sectional view of (A) strut of Resolute DES (91 mm thickness) and (B) swaged strut of R-Onyx DES (81 mm thick- ness), not shown to scale. Both stents are manufactured using a continuous sinusoid wire. The Resolute DES consists of a solid cobalt alloy (shown in gray). The R-Onyx DES is manufactured from a composite wire, which has an outer shell and an inner core. The outer shell, which is in contact with the vessel, is of the identi- cal cobalt chromium alloy used for the Resolute DES. The inner core wire material is a platinum-iridium alloy (shown in white) intended to enhance radiopacity.

Key exclusion criteria included evidence of an acute myocardial infarction (MI) within 72 hr before the intended procedure, planned percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of any vessel within 30 days after the index procedure, and planned PCI of the target vessel(s) within 12 months after the procedure. After the procedure, patients received aspirin 75–325 mg daily indefinitely and a thienopyridine daily for at least 6 months and up to 12 months in patients who were not at high risk of bleeding [9]. All enrolled patients were required to undergo angiography at 8 months at the center where the index procedure was performed. Clinical follow-up was per- formed at 30 days, 6 months, and 8 months postintervention. The institutional review board at each center approved the study protocol, and all patients provided written informed consent. A Data Monitoring Committee continuously monitored the ongoing safety and scientific validity of the study, and an independent Clinical Events Committee adjudicated clinical endpoints. 2.3 | Quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) QCA was performed after bolus infusion of intracoronary nitrates dur- ing the index procedure and at 8-month follow-up. A cohort of patients was enrolled in an IVUS sub-study, in which IVUS was performed at the end of the index procedure and at the time of the 8-month angio- gram. An independent core laboratory performed the QCA and IVUS analyses (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center - Cardiovascular Imag- ing Core Laboratory, Boston, MA and Cardiovascular Research Founda- tion, NY, respectively). 2.4 | Study endpoints The primary endpoint was in-stent late lumen loss at 8 months post- procedure. Secondary angiographic endpoints included binary angio- graphic restenosis, defined as \u001550% diameter stenosis (DS). Secondary clinical endpoints included acute device, lesion, and procedure success; cardiac death; target vessel MI; cardiac death and target vessel MI combined; TLR; target lesion failure (TLF); stent thrombosis; and major adverse cardiac events (MACE; defined as death, Q-wave and non-Q- wave MI, emergency coronary bypass surgery, or clinically driven repeat TLR). Additional endpoints in the IVUS subgroup included the rate of incomplete stent apposition (categorized as persistent or late), neointimal hyperplastic volume, and percent volume obstruction. 2.5 | Statistical analyses The primary endpoint of in-stent late lumen loss at 8 months post- procedure was compared to the angiographic cohort of the single-arm RESOLUTE US Clinical Trial using a non-inferiority margin of 0.20 mm adjusting for propensity score quintile. A total sample size of 75 patients (60 evaluable patients assuming an 80% angiographic follow-up rate) was calculated to yield >80% power to detect noninferiority using a 2- sample t test with a 1-sided significance level of 0.05, assuming a true equivalence of the means between the 2 groups and a relatively smaller standard deviation of 0.45 mm for R-Onyx DES. The propensity score method was used to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics between the cohorts since patients in the two cohorts were not directly randomized. Propensity scores were calculated using the following cova- riates: lesion length, baseline reference vessel diameter (RVD), age, sex, diabetes, history of MI, and Canadian Cardiovascular Society angina class. If non-inferiority of in-stent late lumen loss was demonstrated and a numerically smaller in-stent late lumen loss with R-Onyx DES was observed, then a superiority analysis was performed using propensity score adjustment. An independent statistician who was blinded to the study outcomes performed the propensity score analysis and submitted propensity score calculations to the Food and Drug Administration for review and approval prior to any data analysis. Categorical variables are expressed as counts and percentages and continuous variables are presented as mean 6 standard deviation. All analyses were performed using SAS for Windows, version 9.1 or higher (SAS, Cary, NC). 3 | RESULTS 3.1 | Patient characteristics A total of 75 patients with 85 lesions were enrolled and underwent stent placement in 1 or more lesions. Patient flow is illustrated in Figure 2, and baseline demographics and clinical characteristics are shown in Table 1 and Supporting Information Table S2. The average patient age was 66.16 9.4 years, 73.3% of patients were male, and 32.0% had diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, 40% of patients had undergone prior PCI. Proce- dural and lesion characteristics are presented in Table 2. The mean lesion length was 14.286 6.68 mm, the mean RVD was 2.576 0.48 mm, and 85.9% of the lesions were American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association class B2 or C. Vascular access was performed by the radial approach in the majority of cases (61.3%). Per-protocol, pre-dilata- tion was performed on all lesions; post-dilatation was performed in 51.1% of cases. Device and lesion success rates were both 100%. 3.2 | Angiographic outcomes The primary endpoint, in-stent late lumen loss at 8 months, was 0.246 0.39 mm for R-Onyx DES compared with 0.366 0.52 mm for the historical Resolute DES control (upper limit of the propensity score adjusted one-sided 95% confidence interval of the mean difference5 20.02 mm, P< 0.001 for noninferiority and P 5 0.029 for superiority; Figure 3). Late luminal loss stratified by propensity score quintile is shown in Supporting Information Table S3. Angiographic in-stent binary restenosis occurred in 4 patients (5.5%) and in-segment binary restenosis occurred in 6 patients (8.2%). Other angiographic endpoints are shown in Table 3. In-stent late lumen loss was 0.296 0.48 among diabetics compared with 0.216 0.34 among nondiabetics (P5 0.48). 3.3 | IVUS cohort At 8 months, incomplete stent apposition was present in 2 of the 20 evaluable lesions in the IVUS cohort (10%).

There were no cases of late acquired incomplete stent apposition. Neointimal hyperplastic volume was 9.886 9.38 mm3 and percent volume obstruction was 6.886 8.00% (Table 3). 3.4 | Clinical outcomes Clinical outcomes are presented in Table 4. At 8-month follow-up, the rate of TLF was 6.7% (5 patients; Figure 4). Clinically driven TLR occurred in 3 patients (4%), target vessel MI in 2 patients (2.7%; both attributed to peri-procedural MIs that occurred at the index procedure), and there were no cardiac deaths. There was one episode of stent thrombosis, which occurred on the day of index procedure. FIGURE 2 Patient disposition.

This low late loss was reflected clinically in low rates of TLF and clinically driven TLR. These findings support the hypothesis that specific characteristics of the R-Onyx DES stent, including thinner struts, greater radiopacity, modified strut shape, and identical drug density but generally lower overall drug load compared with the predicate Resolute DES, may have contributed to superior angiographic outcomes with 100% device and lesion success rates in this cohort of patients with complex lesion anat- omy according to ACC/AHA lesion scores. Several factors may have resulted in the superior in-stent late lumen loss with the R-Onyx DES. Randomized trials of bare metal stents have demonstrated that for stents with similar design, the risk for restenosis is dependent on strut thickness [10]. The R-Onyx DES has identical drug dose density and polymer coating composition as the Resolute DES and Resolute Integrity, but with slightly less total drug load in most sizes. The results of the current study support the hypothesis that continued reduction in strut thickness can improve late lumen loss when radial strength is preserved, even when compared with current generation DES. Furthermore, the results confirm that any differences in total drug load with R-Onyx DES did not negatively affect angiographic outcomes. Strut shape may also affect endotheliali- zation, neointimal hyperplasia, and possibly stent thrombosis by influ- encing endothelial shear stress (6). The R-Onyx stent has a “swaged” shape compared with Resolute DES (Figure 1). Further study is required to determine whether the swaged shape of the R-Onyx strut favorably influences outcomes beyond acute deliverability. The rates of TLF and clinically driven TLR at 8-month follow-up for R-Onyx DES were 6.7% (5 events) and 4% (3 events), respectively.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\fThese rates compare favorably with those observed at 9-month fol- low-up in the angiographic sub-study of the RESOLUTE-US clinical trial (11.2% and 8.2% for TLF and clinically driven TLR, respectively). This is despite the greater anatomic complexity enrolled in the current study, in which 86% of the target lesions were classified as ACC/AHA type B2/C, compared with 75% of the target lesions in the RESOLUTE-US clinical trial. While such comparisons are underpowered and unad- justed, the relative rates of the clinical outcomes are qualitatively con- sistent with the angiographic outcomes demonstrated in the current study. The enhanced radiopacity of the R-Onyx stent might have also contributed to the low clinical event rates that were observed, since geographic miss has been associated with increased MACEs, including target vessel revascularization [11], although this is speculative. More- over, TLF rates for R-Onyx were also similar to that of other DES with similar radiopacity [12]. Given the acute performance characteristics and the observed late loss of the R-Onyx DES, the findings of the cur- rent study indirectly support the incremental clinical utility of the R- Onyx over the predicate Resolute DES, particularly in the setting of complex lesion anatomy. Further, larger studies are required to confirm that the angiographic outcomes associated with R-Onyx DES translate into improved longer-term, stent-oriented clinical outcomes, and to compare the clinical outcomes with the various newest generations of thin-strutted, visible DES. 4.1 | Limitations The RESOLUTE ONYX Core trial was not randomized. However, base- line differences between R-Onyx DES and the historical control were adjusted using the propensity score method, incorporating the known predictors of late lumen loss. Resolute DES was chosen as the historical control for this trial instead of R-Integrity DES, as late lumen loss meas- urements were available for Resolute DES through the Resolute-US trial. R-Integrity DES and Resolute DES have the same drug density and there are no significant differences in stent geometry or drug dis- tribution. Superiority testing was a secondary analysis only if noninfer- iority was achieved. The study had a small sample size and was not powered for individual clinical outcomes. 5 | CONCLUSIONS In-stent late lumen loss is non-inferior, and appears to be superior, with the thin-strut novel composite wire Resolute Onyx DES compared with Resolute DES. Continued evolution of stent design can improve angio- graphic outcomes, even in the current era of next-generation DES.

Over several non- inferiority trials, the BP-SES has demonstrated itself to be a safe and effective therapy for obstructive coronary ar- tery disease. This article reviews the current evidence of the efﬁcacy of the BP-SES and examines its performance in high-risk populations, such as patients presenting with ST-segment myocardial infarction, chronic total occlu- sions, diabetes, and small vessel disease. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Introduction In recent years, a series of advances in stent technology has led to steady improvements in rates of restenosis and stent thrombosis and has reduced the need for repeat revascularization. The development of ultrathin struts, improvements in polymer biocompatibility, and the de- velopment of bioresorbable polymers have all aimed to decrease early stent thrombosis and reduce local inﬂammatory and hypersensitivity reactions, leading to reduced rates of in-stent restenosis, need for revas- cularization, and lower incidence of other adverse clinical events [1]. Biodegradable-polymer stents were designed to allow the steady and controlled eluting of antiproliferative drugs in the early phases of treat- ment. This mitigates neointimal hyperplasia [2] while at the same time, through the polymer's degradation, removing the nidus of inﬂamma- tion at the vessel interface that is thought to be responsible for the “catch up” phenomenon of very late stent thrombosis observed with early generation drug-eluting stents (DES) [3]. The Orsiro BP-SES is available in diameters of 2.25, 2.5, 2.75, 3.0, 3.5, and 4.0 mm, and is available in lengths ranging from 9 to 40 mm. Stents with diameters of 2.25 to 3.0 mm have a strut thickness of 60 μm, while stents with diameters of 3.5 to 4.0 mm have a strut thickness of 80 μm [4]. Drawing together recent technological advances, the Orsiro coro- nary stent (Biotronik, Buelach, Switzerland) consists of two distinct layers packaged around its metallic struts [2]. The innermost layer of the system consists of a cobalt‑chromium alloy PRO-Kinetic energy™ stent arranged in a double helix pattern, which is designed to improve ﬂexibility and deliverability. The middle proBIO™ layer consists of a silicon carbide coating that seals the metal alloy surface and reduces the allergenic interaction of metal ions with the vessel wall and blood pool [5]. Finally, the outer BIOlute™ layer is composed of a bioabsorbable poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) polymer contain- ing the antiproliferative sirolimus agent. The active BIOlute™ coating is distributed in an asymmetric fashion on the struts, with a thickness of 7.5 μm on the abluminal side and a thinner 3.5-μm layer on the luminal portion of the stent. Fig. 1 demonstrates the stent strut design. The PLLA polymer undergoes a hydrolytic reaction upon contact with the blood pool, causing the polymer to break down into CO2 and H2O via the Krebs cycle. The sirolimus load is 1.4 μg/mm2 [6] with the elution opti- mized for 12 to 14 weeks after implantation. Fig. 2 summarizes some of the key design features in comparison with other contemporary stent designs. In vitro studies have shown that within 30 days, 50% of the drug is eluted, and within 3 months, 80% is eluted. The PLLA degrades over 2 years, leaving the thin-strut cobalt‑chromium stent with minimal en- dothelial injury [5]. This hybrid approach of combining ultrathin struts, a passive intermediate layer, and bioabsorbable polymer is aimed at creating less ﬂow disturbance, limiting the long-term inﬂammatory Cardiovascular Revascularization Medicine 21 (2020) 540–548 Abbreviations: BP-SES, biodegradable-polymer sirolimus-eluting stent; CTO, chronic total occlusion; CI, conﬁdence interval; DCB, drug-coated balloon; DES, drug-eluting stent; DP-DES, durable-polymer drug-eluting stent; LLL, late lumen loss; PLLA, poly-L-lac- tic acid polymer; PP-EES, permanent-polymer everolimus-eluting stent; STEMI, ST- elevation myocardial infarction; TLF, target lesion failure; TLR, target lesion revasculariza- tion; TVF, target vessel failure; TVR, target vessel revascularization. ⁎ Corresponding author at: MedStar Washington Hospital Center, 110 Irving St., NW, Suite 4B-1, Washington, DC 20010, United States of America.

In larger stent diameters, where the comparative advantage of strut thickness is less (80 μm in stents with diameters N3.5 mm), the additional design features of the inert silicon carbide layer and biodegradable polymer may still confer beneﬁts in vascular healing and long-term inﬂammation in comparison with other contemporary stents of similar strut thickness. 2. Discussion Several investigator- and industry-initiated randomized controlled trials have examined the efﬁcacy and safety of the Orsiro BP-SES in re- cent years. Cumulatively, these trials have enrolled close to 30,000 pa- tients around the world and have examined de novo lesions, acute coronary syndromes, and high-risk subgroups such as small-vessel dis- ease, diabetes, and chronic total occlusions. Table 1 describes the key randomized trials and registries, which are discussed below, followed by an additional focused discussion on the Orsiro BP-SES performance in high-risk subgroups. 2.1. The BIOFLOW trials The introduction of drug-eluting stents (DES) brought about major advances in combating early restenosis but also raised concerns about delayed intimal healing and prolonged inﬂammation [7] at the site of implant, leading to late events such as stent thrombosis and in-stent re- stenosis [8]. The development of biodegradable-polymer stents was intended to reduce the local inﬂammatory response and allow im- proved endothelization, decreasing the risk of late events such as stent thrombosis and in-stent restenosis [9]. Starting in 2013, the BIOFLOW trials were conducted to examine the safety, efﬁcacy, and noninferiority of the Orsiro BP-SES against several leading second-generation DES. Re- sults of these studies were used to support regulatory approval for the use of the Orsiro stent system in Europe, Japan, China, and the United States. BIOFLOW I [6] was a ﬁrst-in-man study designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the newly developed Orsiro BP-SES hybrid stent system. The trial included 30 patients with de novo lesions and demonstrated a low rate of in-stent restenosis with late lumen loss (LLL) of 0.05 ± 0.22 mm over the 9-month follow-up period. Though small, the BIOFLOW I study demonstrated that there was merit in the technology and, more importantly, that it was safe, with no myocardial infarction (MI) or stent thrombosis reported. The follow-on BIOFLOW II [3] study was a prospective, international, randomized controlled, noninferiority trial that compared Orsiro BP- SES in a 2:1 allocation ratio with the benchmark stent of the day, Xience Prime (Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, California). The trial also included a subgroup analysis, which allocated patients to repeat optical coherence tomography (OCT) for disease occurring in small vessels (b2.75 mm di- ameter) and diabetic patients (n = 55). The initial 9-month follow-up data published in 2015 showed non-inferior LLL compared with Xience (Orsiro 0.10 ± 0.32 mm vs. Xience 0.11 ± 0.29 mm, pnoninferiority b 0.0001). Similar to BIOFLOW I, no events of deﬁnite or probable stent thrombosis were reported in the Orsiro BP-SES group (298 patients, 332 lesions) [3]. The 5-year clinical follow-up data released in 2018 showed noninferior target lesion failure (TLF) (Orsiro 10.4% vs. Xience 12.7%, p = 0.473) with signiﬁcantly lower mortality in vessels b2.75 mm (Orsiro 3.7% vs. 11.3%, P = 0.022), [10] suggesting that the 60-μm thin Orsiro BP-SES proﬁle may provide additional beneﬁt in small-vessel subgroups. The recent publication of BIOFLOW VI [11] in China conﬁrms the noninferior rates of LLL (Orsiro 0.05 mm ± 0.21 mm vs. Xience Prime 0.07 mm ± 0.2 mm) and TLF (Orsiro 2.3% vs. Xience 1.8%, p = 0.7505) when compared with Xience. The BIOFLOW III [12,13] trial built on the ﬁndings of BIOFLOW II and aimed to gather “real world” data on TLF at 12 months using a prospec- tive, open-label, registry-based design. Enrolling close to 1400 patients, the registry reported a TLF rate of 5.1% over 12 months (95% CI 4.0% to 6.4%), with a rate of 10% (95% CI 8.4% to 12.0%) in the 5-year follow- up study [12]. Low rates of stent thrombosis similar to previous trials were observed (0.2% at 12 months, 95% CI 0.1% to 0.7%). BIOFLOW IV [14] was designed as a noninferiority trial to allow reg- ulatory approval in Japan. A total of 579 patients with de novo lesions were randomized in a 2:1 fashion to receive Orsiro BP-SES vs. the Xience permanent-polymer everolimus-eluting stent (PP-EES). Patients for planned intervention and patients presenting with MI in the previous 72 h were excluded. A total number of 385 patients (441 lesions) were enrolled. Twelve-month follow-up data reported a noninferior rate of target vessel failure (TVF) in de novo lesions compared with Xience (Orsiro 5.5% vs. Xience7.5%, pnoninferiority b 0.0001). These data echoed the previous European BIOFLOW I, II, and III ﬁndings with simi- lar rates of TLF and stent thrombosis, demonstrating applicability of those ﬁndings to the Japanese population and facilitating Japanese reg- ulatory approval in January 2018 [15]. Five-year follow-up is ongoing, with results expected in 2024. With regulatory approval in hand in both Europe and Japan, the BIOFLOW V [2] trial randomized patients to receive Orsiro BP-SES or Xience in patients presenting for elective or urgent percutaneous coro- nary intervention (PCI) at 90 hospitals across 13 countries, including the United States for the ﬁrst time. The primary endpoint of the trial was TLF at 12 months. Of patients included in the study, 51% presented with an acute coronary syndrome. Although BIOFLOW V was powered as a non- inferiority trial, over the initial 12-month period, the incidence of TLF was signiﬁcantly lower in the Orsiro BP-SES group than in the Xience DP-EES group (Orsiro 6.2% vs. Xience 9.6%, p = 0.0399) and was likely driven by a lower rate of target vessel MI in the Orsiro BP-SES group (Orsiro 5% vs. Xience 8%, p = 0.0155) [16]. In order to improve endpoint detection and statistical signiﬁcance, the authors of BIOFLOW V incorporated the results of BIOFLOW II and IV and used a Bayesian analysis [17]. This pooled analysis showed a TLF rate of 3% in the Orsiro BP-SES group with a posterior probability for noninferiority of 100% and a posterior probability of superiority of 97% [2]. A subsequent landmark analysis of the BIOFLOW V data con- ﬁrmed that the statistically signiﬁcant differences in TLF and target ves- sel MI reported at one year persisted through two-year follow-up [18]. Shortly after BIOFLOW V's publication, the Food and Drug Administra- tion granted approval for use of the device in the United States [19]. 2.2. The BIOSCIENCE, BIO-RESORT, BIONYX, and SORT OUT VII and IX trials In addition to the data provided by the BIOFLOW studies, several large-scale investigator-initiated trials demonstrating the safety and efﬁ- cacy of the Orsiro BP-SES have also emerged. Fig. 3 shows rates of TLF at 12 months from selected prospective randomized controlled trials com- paring the Orsiro BP-SES with the Xience PP-EES. The BIOSCIENCE [1] trial, published in 2014, was similar to BIOFLOW II in design and was a large scale, 1:1 randomized noninfe- riority trial. Unlike BIOFLOW II, however, patients with acute coro- nary syndrome in the preceding 72 h were included. Patient enrollment was completed in 12 months, with 2119 patients and 3139 lesions enrolled. The primary endpoint of TLF at 12 months showed that Orsiro BP-SES was non-inferior to Xience DP-EES (Orsiro 6.5% vs. Xience 6.6%, pnoninferiority b 0.0004), similar to the ﬁndings of BIOFLOW II. A novel ﬁnding, however, was the subgroup analysis in patients treated with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). In the prespeciﬁed subgroup of acute coronary syndromes with STEMI, the Orsiro BP-SES was associated with a lower risk of TLF than the Xience PP-EES at 12 months (Orsiro 3.3% vs. Xience 8.7%, p = 0.024) [1,20]. The BIOSCIENCE 5-year follow-up data [20] failed to show any difference in the TLF rate at 5 years between the two groups, suggesting that the reduction seen at 12 months may be related to the BP-SES's ultrathin struts, and that after complete 541 B.J. Forrestal et al. / Cardiovascular Revascularization Medicine 21 (2020) 540–548\fbreakdown of the biodegradable polymer, the risk of very late TLF is similar to that observed with permanent-polymer stents. One question that remained after the publication of the early BIOFLOW trials and the BIOSCIENCE trial was whether the low rates of TLF observed with the Orsiro BP-SES were due to the thin strut design and the absence of a permanent-polymer stent within the vessel wall, re- ducing vascular inﬂammation and the development of neoatherosclerosis. The BIO-RESORT [21] study aimed to answer this question using a large-scale, multicenter three-arm randomized control trial. The 3514 patients who were enrolled included all-comers and acute coronary syndromes with minimal exclusion factors and random- ized patients to receive one of three stents.

Forrestal et al. / Cardiovascular Revascularization Medicine 21 (2020) 540–548\fIntegrity durable-polymer zotarolimus-eluting stent (91 μm, DP-ZES). Over 12 months, the Orsiro BP-SES proved to be noninferior to the durable-polymer Resolute Integrity stents and had similar rates of TVF as the Synergy BP-EES [21,22]. Follow-up data at 2 years showed that TVF was not statistically dif- ferent between the three stents; however, when TLF was examined using a landmark analysis between 12 and 24 months, Orsiro BP-SES fared better than Resolute, with a target vessel revascularization (TVR) rate of 0.6% for Orsiro compared with 1.5% for Resolute, suggesting that Orsiro BP-SES reduced the risk of revascularization after 1 year of follow-up [22]. Based on the rates of TLF seen in the BIOFLOW V [2] and BIO-RESORT [21,22] studies, the Orsiro BP-SES was selected as the comparator for the ﬁrst randomized controlled trial of the newly designed Resolute Onyx stent (Medtronic, Santa Rosa, California, USA) in the BIONYX trial [23]. Resolute Onyx was developed as a thin-strut durable-polymer zotarolimus-eluting stent system. The trial included all comers, ran- domizing 2516 patients in a 1:1 fashion. Both stents showed excellent safety and efﬁcacy, with low rates of deﬁnite or probable stent thrombo- sis in both groups (Orsiro 0.7% vs. Onyx 0.1%, hazard ratio 0.11 [95% CI 0.01–0.87]; p = 0.0112). The primary endpoint of TLF at 12 months was similar in both the Orsiro BP-SES and Onyx groups [23]. Funding has been secured for up to three years of follow-up, with two-year data expected in the coming months. Whereas the BIOFLOW, BIO-RESORT, BIOSCIENCE, and BIONYX trials compared Orsiro BP-SES to durable-polymer systems, the SORT OUT VII trial [24] was the ﬁrst head-to-head trial against a biodegradable- polymer system. The registry-based, multicenter, noninferiority trial randomized patients to receive the Orsiro BP-SES or the Nobori (stain- less-steel, biolimus-eluting, 120-μm strut) stent. The trial enrolled 2525 patients, with TLF at 12 months being the primary endpoint. Orsiro BP-SES was shown to be noninferior to Nobori at 12 months with re- spect to TLF (Orsiro 3.8% vs. Nobori 4.6%, 95% CI 0.12–0.92; pnoninferiority = 0.034). The rates of reported TLF were most likely lower than re- ported in the large BIOSCIENCE trial (6.5%), as the SORT OUT (3.8%) trial excluded procedure-related MI because of the registry-based de- sign. In addition, the Orsiro BP-SES demonstrated a statistically lower rate of deﬁnite of probable stent thrombosis at 12 months (Orsiro 0.4% vs. Nobori 1.2%, p = 0.03) [24]. Further studies against polymer-free drug-coated stents, such as the SORT OUT IX [25] trial, showed that the biolimus-based BioFreedom stent failed to meet the criteria for noninferiority of TLF at 12 months compared with Orsiro BP-SES, likely driven by a lower rate of target lesion revascularization (TLR) in the Orsiro BP-SES arm of the study [26]. Recent meta-analyses have suggested that the improved rates of TLF may be re- lated to an increased risk of stent thrombosis in thick-strut platforms such as 120-μm Nobori and 120-μm BioFreedom stents compared with the 60- μm Orsiro BP-SES system [27–29]. Data provided by the Swedish Coronary Angiography and Angioplasty Registry (SCAAR) corroborate the results seen in randomized trials. An analysis over the 6-year period from October 2011 to June 2017 including 74,131 patients (4561 in the Orsiro group compared to 69,570 who re- ceived other frequently used DES) showed signiﬁcantly lower rates of TLR in the Orsiro group (Orsiro 1.6% vs. other DES 2.3%, adjusted HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.60–0.94; p = 0.012) [30]. 2.3. Evidence in high-risk subgroups PCI in high-risk subgroups can present several challenging patient and lesion characteristics and can result in increased rates of in-stent re- stenosis, TVF, and stent thrombosis. The following section will address the performance of the Orsiro BP-SES in these high-risk subgroups. 2.3.1. ST-elevation myocardial infarction Patients presenting with STEMI pose several challenges to PCI. Malapposition of stent struts may result from undersizing and subse- quent thrombus resolution, setting the stage for an increased risk of early stent thrombosis [31]. Although the development of DES allowed for substantial improvements in early stent thrombosis, concerns remained about delayed vascular healing due to hypersensitivity and inﬂammation induced by permanent-polymer stents [32,33]. The thin- strut proﬁle coupled with the inert silicon carbide coating of the Orsiro BP-SES has shown promise in reducing rates of TLF, based on subgroup analyses in larger recent trials [2,20,31,34]. The BIOSCIENCE trial's 12- and 24-month [1,22] results demon- strated improved outcomes in STEMI patients. Twelve-month rates of TLF were reported at 3.3% vs. 8.7% in the BP-SES and DP-EES groups (risk ratio [RR] 0.38, p = 0.024) with 24-month data showing rates of 5.4% vs 10.8% (RR 0.48, p = 0.043) [32]. Most notably, the lower observed rates of TLF appeared to be driven by decreased rates of cardiac death or MI in the BP-SES group (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.21–1.02, p = 0.05) [32]. BIOFLOW V data showed a similar reduc- tion in TLF with a reported hazard ratio of 0.50 (95% CI 0.28–0.89) compared to DP-EES [2]. The combined results of the BIOFLOW V and BIOSCIENCE noninferi- ority trials and the demonstrated improved outcomes led to the design of the BIOSTEMI trial [35]. The trial enrolled 1300 patients presenting with STEMI with 1:1 randomization to the BP-SES or DP-EES treatment group. Unlike previous trials powered for noninferiority, BIOSTEMI demonstrated, for the ﬁrst time, clear superiority with respect to rates of TLF at 12 months in patients presenting with STEMI (Orsiro 4% vs. Xience 6%, rate ratio 0.59, posterior probability of superiority 0.986) [36]. The difference in the rates of TLF was driven primarily by fewer cases of clinically indicated TLR in the Orsiro group.

Forrestal et al. / Cardiovascular Revascularization Medicine 21 (2020) 540–548\f2.3.2. Chronic total occlusions Chronic total occlusions (CTOs) present one of the toughest envi- ronments for stent performance with respect to in-stent thrombosis and late or very late in-stent restenosis [37,38]. When compared to de novo lesions, CTOs are typically longer and more calciﬁed, often require multiple stents with overlapping segments, and may un- dergo late vessel remodeling as blood ﬂow increases, leading to va- sodilation and stent-strut malapposition, setting the stage for thrombosis or in-stent restenosis [39,40]. The PRISON IV [40] trial set out to evaluate the Orsiro BP-SES performance in this challenging population. Enrolling 330 patients, the trial randomized patients to receive Orsiro BP-SES or Xience in a 1:1 allocation. Of patients en- rolled in both arms of the trial, 99% underwent repeat angiography at 9 months and clinical follow-up at 12 months. PRISON IV failed to meet the primary endpoint of noninferior LLL at 9 months of Orsiro BP-SES compared with Xience and showed a signiﬁcantly higher rate of binary restenosis in the Orsiro BP-SES group (Orsiro 8.0% vs. Xience 2.1%, p = 0.028). The recent publication of the 3-year follow up data of the PRISION IV trial [41] gives the best long-term follow up of the Orsiro BP-SES's per- formance in CTOs. Over the three years of follow-up, the cumulative in- cidence of major adverse clinical events was higher in the Orsiro BP-SES arm than in the Xience EES arm (9.7% vs. 4.2%). Similar trends were also seen with respect to TLR over the study period favoring Xience with TLR rates reported as 9.7% in the Orsiro arm versus 3.4% in the Xience arm. A landmark analysis demonstrated that after one year, rates of TLR overall remained low but were higher in the Orsiro arm than in the Xience arm (2.1% vs. 0.6%, p-value reported as “NS”) [41]. In a smaller, non-randomized study, Markovic et al. [38] examined LLL at 9 months in patients receiving the Resolute Integrity zotarolimus- eluting stent versus the Orsiro BP-SES. Rates of LLL were signiﬁcantly less in the Orsiro BP-SES arm (Orsiro 0.24 ± 0.53 mm vs. Resolute Integ- rity 0.59 ± 0.72 mm, p = 0.01), but this did not translate into a difference in clinical events up to 24 months of follow-up. Although PRISON IV failed to show noninferiority with respect to LLL, the study was underpowered to detect clinical endpoints. The rates of TVR were higher in PRISON IV compared with BIOSCIENCE (9.2% vs. 4%), but this was probably due to the routine angiographic follow-up at 9 months in the PRISON IV trial as opposed to reported clin- ical events in the BIOSCIENCE trial. Subgroup analyses have demon- strated that the majority of the LLL seen within the PRISON IV study is due to stents with b3 mm in diameter (60-μm strut thickness) vs. stents N3 mm in diameter (80-μm strut thickness) [42]. An additional OCT sub- group analysis demonstrated favorable strut coverage in the Orsiro arm [43]. Despite these ﬁndings, results from CTO patients in BIOFLOW III [12,13] and SORT OUT VII [44] suggest that rates of TLF and TLR remain low in CTO subgroups. 2.3.3. Diabetes A recent meta-analysis pooling diabetic patients from the BIOFLOW II, IV, and V trials examined TLF at 1 year. The analysis included 494 di- abetic patients treated with Orsiro BP-SES and 263 patients treated with Xience across the three BIOFLOW trials. Rates of TLF were similar at one year: 6.3% in the Orsiro BP-SES group and 8.7% in the Xience group (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.047–1.43, p = 0.493) [16]. These ﬁndings were conﬁrmed in a subgroup analysis of the SORT OUT VII trial [45]. Rates of TLF among patients treated with or without insulin were also found to be similar [45]. 2.3.4. Small-vessel disease Small-vessel disease, generally deﬁned as vessels b2.75 mm in diameter, has been associated with a greater risk of TLR due to in- creased rates of in-stent restenosis [46,47]. Data from BIOFLOW II [10] and a subgroup analysis from BIO-RESORT [48] suggest that the ultrathin Orsiro BP-SES may provide additional beneﬁt in small-vessel subgroups. BIOFLOW II contained 259 patients within the small-vessel sub- group (≤2.75 mm) and demonstrated 5-year TLF rates of 11.1% in the BP-SES arm vs. 15.5% in the DP-EES arm (p = 0.303), a difference that was mainly due to a lower rate of death in the BP-SES arm (3.7% vs. 11.3%, p = 0.039) [10]. A subsequent analysis of the BIO-RESORT trial examined the 3-year outcomes in 1506 of the 3514 total trial participants. A multivariate analysis later showed that BP-SES was independently associated with lower rates of TLR at 3 years in com- parison with the everolimus and zotarolimus treatment groups (ad- justed HR 0.42, 95% CI 0.20–0.85, p = 0.02). No differences were reported in the rates of cardiac death, target vessel MI, or stent thrombosis at 3 years [48]. Results from the small-vessel cohort of the BIOSCIENCE trial [47] released in August 2019 differed somewhat from the results of the BIOFLOW II and BIO-RESORT small-vessel subgroups. The ≤2.75-mm small-vessel cutoff used in BIOFLOW II and BIO- RESORT, versus the deﬁnition of ≤3 mm or N 3 mm to deﬁne small- versus large-vessel disease used in BIOSCIENCE, potentially accounts for the discrepant results. Five-year rates of TLF were not found to be signiﬁcantly different between the BP-SES and DP-EES groups (22.3% vs. 18.3%, respectively; rate ratio 1.22, 95% CI 0.94–1.58, p = 0.13) [47]. Fig. 3.

Forrestal et al. / Cardiovascular Revascularization Medicine 21 (2020) 540–548\f2.3.5. In-stent restenosis Despite recent advances in stent technology, neoatherosclerosis due to inﬂammation, drug toxicity, and delayed vascular healing can result in revascularization rates of up to 10% [4,49]. The inert sil- icon carbide proBIO layer has the potential to improve biocompati- bility at the vessel interface and to reduce the proliferation of tissue, which leads to in-stent restenosis. However, to date, there are limited available randomized data on the efﬁcacy of BP-SES ver- sus existing second-generation DES in treating in-stent restenosis, with only 10 patients within the all-comer BIOSCIENCE trial and 30 within BIO-RESORT. Current European guidelines advocate for the use of drug-coated balloons (DCBs) or DES in the treatment of in-stent restenosis, but there are limited data on the efﬁcacy of latest-generation stents [50]. The BIOLUX trial [49] aimed to address this gap, randomizing 229 pa- tients with in-stent restenosis in a 2:1 fashion to receive treatment with a butyryl trihexyl citrate (BTHC)-based paclitaxel DCB versus BP- SES. In-stent LLL at 6 months and TLF at 12 months were compared be- tween both groups. Over the study period, DCB proved noninferior to BP-SES, with LLL in DCB arm reported at 0.03 ± 0.40 mm and 0.20 ± 0.70 mm in the BP-SES arm (p = 0.40). Rates of TLF at 12 and 18 months were also similar, demonstrating that both options seem fea- sible and effective but that further studies are needed in this challenging cohort of patients [49]. 2.4. Economic impact In addition to the improved clinical outcomes demonstrated in the BIOFLOW V trial, recent economic modeling has also suggested possible economic beneﬁts [51]. Markov economic modeling has shown that the reduction in rates of TLR and target vessel MI resulted in a cumulative reduction of $2415 per patient over a 48-month period compared to Xience [52]. With rising healthcare costs, these savings are an important consideration, not only for individual patients and insurance payers, but also for healthcare policymakers [51]. While caution should be exercised in interpreting this single sub-analysis, healthcare spending in the US alone is projected to reach 20% of gross domestic product by 2025 [53], so the delivery of safe, clinically effective and potentially eco- nomically viable treatments is an important consideration for any healthcare system. 3. Limitations The Orsiro BP-SES does have some notable limitations. The presence of the ultrathin struts may make the stent a less favorable choice in sit- uations requiring high radial force to prevent vessels recoil, such as CTOs, as described in a previous section. Additionally, data on the per- formance of the Orsiro BP-SES in heavily calciﬁed lesions is limited, mainly arising from small subgroups of “all-comers” trials, making any deﬁnite statements about the device's performance in this space difﬁcult. On a practical level, the ultrathin-stent struts can be difﬁcult to visu- alize using ﬂuoroscopy, so careful conﬁrmation of the stent position should be performed before deployment. 4. Future directions Several ongoing trials are continuing to investigate the efﬁcacy and effectiveness of the Orsiro BP-SES in comparison to other contemporary stents. The enhanced biocompatibility and ultrathin-strut design may also have a role to play in high-bleeding-risk populations by allowing for shortened dual antiplatelet therapy duration, which will be exam- ined in the planned BIOFLOW-DAPT study. With the favorable outcomes of the Orsiro BP-SES, ongoing developments in stent technology, such as the incorporation of CD34+ antibodies into bioabsorbable-polymer stents (COMBO™, OrbusNeich, Hoevalaken, the Netherlands), aimed at encouraging endothelial progenitor cell growth and vascular healing, are now being compared to the Orsiro BP-SES [54]. 5. Conclusions Overall, the Orsiro BP-SES has demonstrated its safety and nonin- feriority in numerous randomized clinical trials [1,3,14,20,48]. The combination of the ultrathin-strut design and inert proBIO silicon carbide layer allowing enhanced biocompatibility has demonstrated low rates of TLR against comparators and low rates of stent thrombo- sis. In speciﬁc high-risk subgroups, such as patients with STEMI and CTOs, notable exceptions have emerged, with lower rates of cardiac death and MI in STEMI patients [36], yet higher rates of TLR and major adverse cardiac events suggested in patients with CTOs [41]. Additional appropriately powered randomized controlled studies are needed to examine the role of the Orsiro BP-SES in other high- risk subgroups, including high-bleeding-risk patients, CTOs, and in- stent restenosis.

It features: Best-in-class deliverability2 Enhanced visibility with thinner struts2 Smooth side branch access2 Fast healing3 The broadest diameter range\fSinusoid-formed wire Helical wrap Laser-fused Competitive comparison Resolute Onyx DES is more deliverable than laser-cut SYNERGY™* XD and XIENCE Skypoint™*, which are stiffer. Deliverability comparison — 3.0 mm DES2 (Lower is better) THE ONLY DES DESIGNED FROM A SINGLE WIRE‡ Proven components for optimal healing Watch a short video to learn more about the BioLinx™ polymer. Single-wire design provides a fluid range of motion and the conformability needed for superior strut apposition.2 BioLinx biocompatible polymer provides superior thromboresistance.4 When combined, fast healing occurs as evidenced by nearly 90% strut coverage at 30 days,3 providing the foundation for the Onyx ONE Global Trial. The Onyx ONE Global Trial analysed real-world, high bleeding risk patients on 1-month DAPT treated with a Resolute Onyx DES or a BioFreedom™* DCS.\fResults showed Resolute Onyx DES was safe and effective,1 providing the option to shorten DAPT in patients who are at high bleeding risk. Based on these results, Resolute Onyx DES was the first DES CE-indicated for HBR patients on 1-month DAPT.

Methods: This was a single-centre, retrospective registry analysis that reviewed the clinical data from all patients who were implanted with a Resolute OnyxTM stent between March 2015 and February 2016. Clinical follow-up was performed at 1 year post-implantation. Results: A total of 252 patients received a Resolute OnyxTM stent and two patients were lost to follow-up. The mean age of the cohort was 66.9 years and 113 (45.2%) had diabetes mellitus. Thirty-eight patients (15.2%) had left main disease and 73 (29.2%) had three-vessel disease. A total of 175 patients (70.0%) had small vessel disease (<2.75 mm) and 210 (84.0%) had long lesions (>20 mm). The 1-year target lesion failure was 4.4% (11 of 250), cardiovascular death occurred in eight patients (3.2%), ischaemia-driven target lesion revascularization was undertaken in five patients (2.0%) and stent thrombosis occurred in one patient (0.4%). Conclusion: The Resolute OnyxTM stent showed a favourable 1-year clinical performance in a real-world population.

The latest version of R-ZES, Resolute OnyxTM , was launched in November 2014. This study investigated the 1-year clinical outcomes of patients who had received this new technology. Patients and methods Study design and population This was a single-centre retrospective registry analysis. From the launch of Resolute OnyxTM , all patients treated in the Division of Cardiology, Queen Mary Hospital, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong who had been ﬁtted with a Resolute OnyxTM stent between March 2015 and February 2016 were identiﬁed in the hospital database and recruited to the analysis. There were no exclusion criteria except patients lost to follow-up or those who could not be contacted for assessment at 1 year after stent implantation. Baseline demographics, procedural details and follow-up data were recorded. All treatment and clinical decision-making processes were subject to the attending cardiologists. The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of Queen Mary Hospital, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong (no. UW 17-026). Written informed consent was waived by the Institutional Ethics Committee as this was a retrospective analysis without any alter- ation in patient management. Study endpoints The primary endpoint was 1-year target lesion failure (TLF), deﬁned as a composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction (not clearly attributed to a non-target vessel), or a clinically indicated target lesion revascularization by percutaneous or surgical methods at 12 months. All clinical outcomes were deﬁned according to the Academic Research Consortium (ARC).4 Deaths were considered cardiac unless an unequivocal non-cardiac cause could be established. Secondary endpoints included individual components of the primary out- comes: target vessel myocardial infarction; clinically-driven target lesion revasculariza- tion (TLR), deﬁned as repeat revasculariza- tion within the stented segment including 5 mm proximal and distal border zones; clinically-driven target vessel revasculariza- tion (TVR) and stent thrombosis deﬁned according to the ARC as deﬁnite, probable, or possible.4 A revascularization was con- sidered clinically-driven if repeat angiog- raphy showed a diameter stenosis \u000250% with at least one of the following: (i) history of recurrent angina pectoris, presumably related to the target vessel; (ii) objective signs of ischaemia at rest or during exercise test by electrocardiogram, presumably related to the target vessel; (iii) abnormal test results of invasive functional diagnostic test (fractional ﬂow reserve); or (iv) a TLR with a diameter stenosis \u000270% even in the absence of the aforementioned ischaemic signs or symptoms. Study device Resolute OnyxTM (Medtronic Inc., Santa Rosa, CA, USA) is a zotarolimus-eluting stent designed for higher procedural success and better acute performance. The design is based on its predecessor, the ResoluteTM Integrity drug-eluting stent, which was extensively studied in the Resolute Global Clinical Program.3 In brief, the stent is manufactured using continuous sinusoid technology that employs a single strand of wire to form a sinusoidal pattern of crowns, 458 Journal of International Medical Research 46(1)\fwhich is laser fused at selected crowns. This distinctive wire-forming facilitates smooth tracking in tortuous vessels and allows excellent conformability.5 The drug polymer BioLinx is highly biocompatible with a hydrophilic surface designed to minimize inﬂammation.6 The polymer elutes the drug zotarolimus, which is a synthetic analogue of sirolimus, over 180 days, with >85% of the zotarolimus dose released by day 60.7 The latest version Resolute OnyxTM utilizes core-wire technology in which the cobalt alloy incorporates a platinum iridium core for increased radiopacity. Moreover, the strut thickness is further reduced to 81 mm (0.0032 inches) with maintained radial strength and the crossing proﬁle is 0.037 mm for the 2.5 mm stent. The Resolute OnyxTM stents used in patients included in this registry study ranged from 2.0 mm to 5.0 mm diameters and the stent lengths were up to 38 mm. Statistical analyses All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSSÕ statistical package, version 19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for WindowsÕ . Continuous variables are as mean \u0003 SD. Categorical values are pre- sented as absolute values or percentages. Comparison of continuous data was per- formed by one-way analysis of variance, Mann–Whitney U-test or independent- samples t-test depending on data distribution. \u00022 -test and Fisher’s exact test were used to compare categorical data. A two-sided P-value of \u00040.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant. Results From March 2015 to February 2016, 252 patients were implanted with Resolute OnyxTM stents. Two patients were lost to follow-up, so 250 patients completed the 1-year assessment and were entered into this analysis. A total of 577 Resolute OnyxTM stents were implanted. Baseline demograph- ics are presented in Table 1; 89 patients (35.6%) had type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), 24 (9.6%) had type 1 diabetes mellitus and 21 patients (8.4%) with end- stage renal failure (ESRF) were on dialysis (haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis). Interventional procedures and lesion details are presented in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. A total of 83 patients (33.2%) presented with acute coronary syndrome including ST elevation myocardial infarction and eight patients (3.2%) had cardiogenic shock. With regard to lesion characteristics, 38 patients (15.2%) had left main involvement, 73 (29.2%) had three-vessel disease; and 175 (70.0%) had small vessel diseases with Resolute OnyxTM 2.5 mm (n ¼ 164), 2.25 mm (n ¼ 111) and 2.0 mm (n ¼ 42) stents implanted. At 1 year, 228 of 239 surviving patients (95.4%) were on dual antiplatelet therapy. Table 1.

Tam et al. 459\fTable 4 shows the 1-year clinical out- comes. The primary endpoint of 1-year TLF was observed in 11 patients (4.4%). One patient suﬀered from ARC probable subacute stent thrombosis. When patients were stratiﬁed according to vessel size, the demographics and 1-year clinical outcomes were similar for patients with and without small vessel disease (Table 5). Of the 21 patients with ESRF who were receiving dialysis during the index procedure, ﬁve patients (23.8%) suﬀered from TLF within 1 year. Discussion To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report of the medium-term clinical perform- ance of the latest evolution of R-ZES, the Resolute OnyxTM stent. These present data demonstrated that the Resolute OnyxTM stent achieved similar eﬃcacy and safety compared with most contemporary DES with a 1-year TLF rate of 4.4%.1 In the Resolute All Comers trial,8 the Resolute zotarolimus-eluting stent and an everoli- mus-eluting stent had 1-year TLF rates of 8.2% and 8.3%, respectively. Although this current retrospective registry has its inherent limitations, this post-marketing study allowed the analysis of all patients including Table 2.

For example, this current cohort included patients with cardiogenic shock, patients with ESRF receiving dialysis, a high pro- portion of patients with T2DM and even patients who presented with cardiac arrest requiring haemodynamic support. This cur- rent cohort reﬂects real-world coronary intervention practices, which is diﬃcult to study in prospective randomized clinical trials. In this present study, many of the TLFs occurred in those ultra-high-risk patients and this further provides insight into the use of the Resolute OnyxTM stent in a real-world population. In the present study, 45% of patients had diabetes mellitus and 70% had small vessel disease. Small vessel stenting has tradition- ally been associated with higher rates of restenosis and repeat revascularizations.9,10 The degree of neointimal proliferation is relatively independent of the reference vessel size and hence the proportion of cross- sectional luminal narrowing is higher in small vessels compared with large vessels.11 The problem is further complicated by the presence of T2DM that predisposes to neointimal hyperplasia while patients with T2DM tend to have diﬀuse small vessel disease.12 These current data suggest that the Resolute OnyxTM stent had similar outcomes in small and large vessel diseases, which is similar to its predecessor stent as demonstrated by the Resolute Global Clinical Program small vessel subgroup analysis.13 Even in ultra-small vessels implanted with a 2.0 mm Resolute OnyxTM stent, the results were satisfactory and fur- ther studies will be required to investigate the optimal treatment of ultra-small vessel diseases. Of the patients in the current study who experienced TLF within 1 year, a signiﬁcant proportion were patients with ESRF receiv- ing dialysis (ﬁve of 11 patients). Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is known to be associated with increased mortality and morbidity from coronary artery disease.14 Particularly in those with ESRF on dialysis, who are frequently excluded from clinical trials, treatment failures are common after revascularization no matter whether percu- taneous coronary intervention (PCI) or cor- onary bypass grafting are performed.15 Even with second-generation DES, the 1-year TLF rate approached 15% and more than 30% needed repeat revascularization in longer term follow-up.16–18 In this current registry, ﬁve out of 21 ESRF patients (24%) suﬀered from TLF within 1 year, which is quite a high proportion. With the aging population, increasing prevalence of T2DM, CKD and better renal support, the incidence of coronary artery disease in patients with ESRF is set to increase. Further advancements in coronary revascularization technology including PCI and stenting is Table 5.

First, a lack of a control group prevents compari- son with other stents. Secondly, the small sample size and low event rates render conclusive outcome and independent pre- dictor analyses diﬃcult. Furthermore, the retrospective study design was subject to selection bias, although it allowed recruit- ment of a real-world PCI practice cohort and only two patients were lost to follow-up. In conclusion, the Resolute OnyxTM stent showed a favourable 1-year clinical per- formance in a real-world population.

Orsiro features a hybrid coating of passive and active components: the PROBIO passive coating seals the metal surface of the stent and prevents interaction with the surrounding blood and tissue, while the BIOlute active coating contains a highly biocompatible polymer that delivers a -limus drug over 12–14 weeks and degrades gently over one to two years, thereby avoiding increased inflammation. The stent backbone is the PRO- Kinetic Energy platform, which has a double-helix stent design and thin struts, bringing flexibility and ease of deliverability.

Since the introduction of drug-eluting stents (DES), physicians have tried to find a delicate balance between achieving a highly effective result without compromising the safety of the patient. Various concepts have been introduced into the marketplace in the attempt to identify the optimal combination of characteristics; however, until now very little attention has been paid to combining a temporary drug therapy with passivation of the metallic stent that is left in the coronary artery. The Orsiro DES (Biotronik AG, Bülach, Switzerland) is the first hybrid DES, offering a unique hybrid coating consisting of passive and active components. The PROBIO passive coating encapsulates the stent and eliminates interaction between the metal stent and the surrounding tissue. The BIOlute active component is a bioabsorbable polymer matrix combined with a -limus drug that is released in a controlled manner, leaving only the PROBIO-coated stent in the long term. The hybrid solution with the PROBIO and BIOlute coatings is delivered using the underlying PRO-Kinetic Energy™ stent system with its thin strut design. This combination of effortless deliverability with a hybrid structure opens up a new generation of devices for improved patient outcomes. PROBIO Passive Coating The PROBIO passive coating seals the stent surface and greatly reduces interaction between the metal stent and the surrounding tissue and blood by acting as a diffusion barrier (see Figure 1). This thin-layer, amorphous silicon carbide coating is deposited onto the surface of the stent through a plasma- enhanced chemical vapour deposition technique. This process covalently bonds the inert coating to the metallic surface. Surface passivation aims to improve the biocompatibility of the material by reducing thrombogenicity and encouraging re-endothelialisation. The PROBIO coating achieves this passivation through its semi-conductive properties by reducing the interactions of protein/cell constituents with the stent surface. Lower diffusion of ions also leads to a lower rate of corrosion and a lower risk of tissue inflammation response as a result of allergic reactions.In vitro studies have shown up to a 96 % reduction of allergenic metal ion release when the stent surface is coated with silicon carbide. PROBIO is well known as it has been used for more than 15 years on all Biotronik-manufactured stents and has been implanted in more than one million patients. In the short term the passive PROBIO coating is covered by the active absorbable polymer coating, but nevertheless PROBIO serves a purpose since ion release can take place through the degrading polymer.

BIOlute Active Coating The BIOlute polymer base is made of poly-L-lactide (PLLA), a well- characterised bioabsorbable polymer that has been approved for medical use in a multitude of applications since the 1960s. The selection of this polymer was made after thorough screening of various polymer materials, both permanent and biodegradable. There are four essential requirements for a carrier polymer: biocompatibility; controlled release of the drug; mechanical stability able to withstand the plastic deformation during stent expansion; and ability to protect the drug from degradation during processes such as sterilisation and during shelf life. Essentially, the desired polymer is one that can provide safe transport of the drug through the vasculature without drug loss and ensure controlled drug release. Release can be controlled by such factors as polymer identity, formulation (drug:polymer ratio) and coating processes. The formulation and coating developed with the desired release properties have to show mechanical properties capable of withstanding implantation. In the development of BIOlute, from those polymers meeting the initial screening parameters, the selection was narrowed to focus on the criteria of biocompatibility as measured by local tissue responses in pig coronaries; this led to the selection of Poly- L-Lactidde (PLLA) as the polymer matrix of BIOlute. Another benefit of PLLA is that its slow degradation allows for full control of release kinetics since the polymer degradation is limited during the drug-elution period, which is not the case with polymers that degrade more quickly. The controlled release kinetics obtained with the homogeneous PLLA polymer matrix also means that Orsiro does not need to have any additional base or top coat, which is often required for other DES coatings. Another advantage of the prolonged gentle degradation seen with PLLA is that it minimises the inflammatory response (see Figure 2). After selection of the appropriate polymer, the next critical step in terms of elution kinetics was ensuring a uniform coating of the polymer and drug. The homogenous coating of the stent was realised using a unique coating technique. The mechanical stability is crucial for carrier systems of DES and BIOLute, due to the high strength of PLLA, is providing very good properties. The polymer thickness on the abluminal side of the Osiro device is 7.4 μm, one of the lowest among available DES (see Figure 3). On Orsiro, a circumferential coating rather than an abluminal coating was chosen to ensure that the polymer adheres to the stent platform even in the areas that face high stress during stent expansion. This, together with the strong mechanical properties of the polymer matrix itself, means that the risk of tearing off the coating as a result of stress during implantation and balloon dilatation is avoided. The highly biocompatible polymer gently degrades over one to two years, avoiding increased inflammation and ultimately metabolises into CO and H O via the Krebs cycle. Studies in minipigs have shown no residual PLLA and benign histology at 24 and 36 months. The biocompatible and gentle degradation is believed to lead to better patient outcomes. The sirolimus drug load is 1.4 μg/mm and the elution is optimised for clinical benefit to 12–14 weeks. (see Figure 4). In vivo studies have demonstrated that 50 % of the drug is released within 30 days and 80 % within three months (see Figure 5). The elution curve is adapted to the therapeutic window of the drug and is in line with that of other -limusbased stents. While studies have noted that -limus drugs as well as paclitaxel are effective in clinical use, -limus drugs have proved to be clinically superior with no significant difference between the different - limus derivatives. 3 4 5 2 2 2 6,7 Expert Panel Discussion View details Performed By: Babar Basir, Dan Burkhoff\fPRO-Kinetic Energy Stent Platform The deliverability and mechanical properties of the underlying stent backbone are known to be key success factor for any DES. To achieve this we use the highly deliverable PRO-Kinetic Energy bare metal stent as a platform for Orsiro. The PRO-Kinetic Energy cobalt–chromium stent platform has a double- helix stent design that allows for increased flexibility without compromising scaffolding or fatigue resistance. The helical meanders give flexibility to the stent for excellent delivery and allow for a smooth crimped surface without fish scaling. The longitudinal connectors provide stability to the double-helical structure for optimal scaffolding and support without sacrificing flexibility. The wedge-shaped transitions at the stent ends allow for scaffolding and flexibility throughout the entire length of the stent. All of these features of the double-helix stent design translate into increased trackability, crossability and ability to conform to the vessel wall. The cobalt– chromium stent material allows for thin struts while maintaining optimal radial strength and radiopacity. Orsiro is noted to have the thinnest struts compared with other DES, specifically down to 60 μm, varying with the available stent diameters of 2.25– 4.0 mm and lengths of 9– 30 mm. This ensures minimal wall injury, leading to better patient outcomes. Adding the polymer to the thin struts of the PRO- Kinetic Energy stent platform, the total thickness of the stent struts of stents with a nominal diameter of up to 3.0 mm is 71 μm – significantly lower than the thickness of competitors, including Xience (Abbott Vascular, Abbott Park, IL, US) at 95 μm and Endeavor Resolute (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, US) at 99 μm. The advanced stent crimping technology provides a low crossing profile (0.99 mm) and the optimised delivery system allows for higher-pressure inflations (mean burst pressure 24–30 atm depending on diameter; rated burst pressure 16 atm). Pre-clinical Results The safety of Orsiro was demonstrated in animal studies. A safety study of both the Orsiro and Cypher (Cordis Corporation, Bridgewater, NJ, US) stents looking specifically at histology and quantitative coronary angiography at four, 12 and 26 weeks in pig coronaries demonstrated that Orsiro with PLLA + sirolimus had a better safety profile than Cypher; the same was seen with an overdose model. Furthermore, an overlap safety study looking at four-week quantitative coronary angiography and histology showed that there was no difference in safety profile and drug effect in the overlapping region of Orsiro. A pharmacokinetic study up to three months showed comparable blood levels and coronary tissue concentrations to a -limus-based DES together with low organ tissue concentrations. A long-term polymer degradation study evaluating histology and histomorphometry up to three years was performed, demonstrating excellent biocompatibility and a lack of late increase in inflammation (data on file, BIOTRONIK AG, under publication). Clinical Programme Orsiro is supported by a comprehensive clinical programme consisting of a series of trials sharing the family name BIOFLOW. BIOFLOW-I is the first-in- man trial with 30 patients conducted in 2009 under the leadership of Professor Martial Hamon (University Hospital of Caen, France). The excellent results of the BIOFLOW-I study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01214148) are on par with other first-in-man trials of contemporary DES and was used for the CE- mark application. The results also served as input to the design of BIOFLOW-II (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01356888), a pan-European randomised controlled trial with 440 patients comparing the Orsiro with the Xience Prime stent that started enrolment in July 2011. BIOFLOW-III is a global, open-label registry that will enrol 1,000+ patients and will also look at pre-specified subgroups including diabetes, small vessels, acute myocardial infarction and chronic total occlusion. Enrolment is scheduled to start in 2011. Conclusion 8\fIn conclusion, Orsiro brings a new strategy to the treatment of coronary artery disease with a hybrid solution of active and passive components. The PROBIO passive coating provides a seal on the metal surface of the stent and the BIOlute active coating provides controlled drug release, with both components preventing an increased inflammatory response. The stent backbone is the PRO-Kinetic Energy platform, which provides flexibility with a double-helix stent design and thin struts. The clinical performance, which has been assessed in initial in vitro and in vivo studies, will be further demonstrated in forthcoming publications. References 1.
