Different methods of surgical occlu- sion of the LAA have been associated with different levels of acute and chronic success rate. This paper presents our experience with LAA occlusion using the AtriClip. Methods: 155 patients undergoing cardiac surgery procedures with epicardial AtriClip ex- clusion of the LAA were enrolled in the study. The AtriClip was placed via a sternotomy, thoracotomy or from a thoracoscopic approach. Postoperative variables such as thrombo- embolic events, clip stability, and endocardial leakage around the device were examined by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and/or computed tomography (CT). Patients were then contacted via telephone and questionnaire regarding episodes of stroke and actual anticoagulation therapy was completed. Results: Avg. age of the study population was 66.9 years (102 males). Clip was implanted from sternotomy or thoracotomy in 77 patients and from thoracoscopy in 78 patients. The perioperative success rate of clip implantation was achieved in 98% of patients. 10 patients (6.4%) were revised for bleeding, but none of the revisions were due to clip implantation. During the hospitalization and follow-up period, consisting of 2422 patient-months, 4 of the cardiac patients experienced transitory ischemic attacks and 2 patients experienced a cerebrovascular attack. Conclusions: Epicardial clip exclusion of the LAA appears to be a reproducible and safe surgical method with a high success rate. Our follow-up conﬁrmed clip stability, complete occlusion of the LAA, and absence of any AF-related thromboembolic events. These results support regular usage of AtriClip during LAA closure. © 2017 The Czech Society of Cardiology. Published by Elsevier Sp. z o.o. All rights reserved. * Corresponding author.

Thrombi in left atrium (LA) are located in 9.8% patients with non-valvular AF and despite the anticoagulation therapy, 3.4% of patients are presented with thrombus in LAA [2]. For this reason, the guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology [3] recommend the exclusion of LAA during the surgical treatment of AF. The advantage of LAA removal during the surgical treatment of AF was conﬁrmed in several non-randomized studies [4,5] and it is also an important part of Cox-MAZE IV procedure [6,7]. LAA occlusion may also play a role in treatment option for patients with chronic AF, who are contraindicated to anticoagulation therapy. This subset of patients with warfarin usage may be as high as 14–44% of cardiac patients [8,9]. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the efﬁciency (no cul de sac, no ﬂow through the clip) and safety (no revision or bleeding due to the clip implantation) of AtriClip implantation. Material and methods Between July 2012 and September 2016, a total of 155 patients underwent a cardiac surgery procedure with AtriClip implan- tation at the Cardiac Surgery Department, Hospital of České Budějovice, Czech Republic. All patients had preoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to document and conﬁrm the absence of pre-existing LAA thrombus. The AtriClip was standardly implanted using the thoracoscopic approach, thoracotomy approach or through sternotomy during concomitant procedures. For purposes of this study, all LAA occlusions were with the AtriClip, or the second generation – AtriClip Pro (AtriCure, West Chester, OH, USA). The implantable device is a self- closing external LAA occluder that is available in 4 sizes, from 35 mm to 50 mm. It consists of two nitinol springs joined by two titanium parallel rods covered with Dacron polyester fabric. Our postoperative anticoagulation strategy followed the hospital protocol. After the MAZE procedure, patients are administered warfarin with a target INR range between 2 and 3. After 3 months, if the patient is in sinus rhythm, warfarin is discontinued and the patient's medication is changed to antiaggregation therapy. Follow-up to assess LAA closure was performed by TEE and some patients from the beginning of the study had also CT examination at 1- to 3-month postoperatively. Criteria of successful LAA occlusion were deﬁned as absence of residual stump or pouch smaller than 1 cm and no persistent ﬂow into the LAA using Doppler echocardiography. Telephone ques- tionnaires focused on documenting any postoperative events – TIA/CVA or intracranial/internal bleeding as well as to conﬁrm compliance with anticoagulation/antiaggregation therapy regimen were administered. Results A total of 155 patients were included in this study. Patients were mainly male (65.8%) and the average age was 66.9 years. 21.9% of patients had suffered from TIA/CVA preoperatively and the average CHA2DS2-VASc score was 2.7 (Table 1). The majority of cases were performed off-pump – during thoraco- scopic AF ablation (45.8%) or as a standalone AtriClip implantation in 4.5% of patients (Table 2). Periprocedural success rate was deﬁned as complete LAA occlusion with no persistent ﬂow into the LAA using Doppler echocardiography and residual stump smaller than 1 cm. The periprocedural success was achieved in 98% of the patients. Three patients who did not meet this criterion had residual stumps of 18 mm, 15 mm and 14 mm (Table 3). These patients were operated thoracoscopically and the two cases were among the series of ﬁrst ten cases. These failures could be attributed to the learning curve of the procedure.

None of these were associated with the AtriClip implantation procedure and all these patients had undergone on-pump procedures (Table 4). One of the patients had bleeding from the distal anastomosis of a venous graft, one from the proximal anastomosis of a venous graft and another one of the patients from an aortic suture after aortic valve replacement. In seven patients the source of postoperative bleeding was not found but was probably caused by diluted coagulopathy. During postoperative hospitalization and re- covery, one patient experienced a CVA that resulted in death. This patient was a 73-year-old woman with CHA2DS2-VASc score of 5 undergoing a CABG plus closure of a patent foramen and concomitant AtriClip implantation. TEE in the ICU did not show a thrombus in the left atrium or on the endocardial side of the closed LAA. Hospital mortality was 8.4%. All of the 13 deaths occurred in the on-pump group and correlated with the group of patients with high preoperative EuroSCORE (avg. 11.8). During the long term follow-up, 4 transitory ischemic attacks were reported (Fig. 1). From the available medical records (TEE or CT), there were no thrombi in the left atrium or on the endocardial side of the closed LAA in these patients. There was not seen any clip migration of structural deteriora- tion of the clip as well. In our group of patients, there was one CVA in patient 1 month after discontinuation of NOAC in the time period of 1 year after thoracoscopic ablation procedure. Follow-up time consisted of 3904 patient-months and mean duration time of follow-up 25.2 \u0006 13.4 months (Table 5). Discussion Different techniques of surgical LAA occlusion are used during cardiac surgery procedures. The most common techniques are ligation, resection, endocardial suture closure and stapler resection. In a paper from Kanderian et al. [10] a success rate of different surgical methods in was compared. A group of 137 patients underwent LAA excision, suture closure or stapler resection. The criterion for complete LAA occlusion was lack of communication (ﬂow) between the LAA and LA and no residual LAA stump greater than 1 cm. Only 73% of resections, 23% of suture closures and 0% of stapler resections met these criteria. Katz et al. examined 50 patients after mitral valve surgery with concomitant LAA ligation. Incomplete ligation was found in 36% of patients with echo contrast or thrombus in LAA in half of them [11]. Gillinov et al. [12] described a group of 222 patients with LAA excision using a stapler. In their paper, the need for acute additional stitches was described in 10% of patients. Incomplete occlusion has negative clinical impact on a patients' future health status. In a paper of Garcia-Fernandez et al. authors assessed 205 patients after mitral valve surgery with appendage ligation performed in 58 patients. In patients with incomplete or undone LAA ligation was described higher stroke risk. After multivariate analysis they identiﬁed a higher risk in patients with incomplete LAA ligation, which has a higher stroke risk than leaving the appendage intact [13]. LAA patency after surgical occlusion was associated with thrombus formation in a paper of Cullen et al. [14], where transesophageal echocardiography was done before cardio- version within 30 days of cardiac surgery. Thrombus occurred in 47% of patients with a patent LAA versus 17% of patients with an absent or non-patent LAA after surgical intervention. The safety, efﬁcacy of AtriClip implantation time was previously described in European and US trials [15,16]. Both studies have shown good results with high success rates of LAA occlusion and no periprocedural complications related to the AtriClip device during follow-up. Both studies included only patients treated with a sternotomy approach. In a paper of Starck et al. [17], they demonstrated complete electrical isolation of the LAA using the AtriClip, what could be beneﬁcial during surgical ablation of atrial ﬁbrillation. Beside the surgical methods of LAA occlusion, different types of catheter devices are available in clinical practice. The Watchman LAA occlusion device from Boston Scientiﬁc is Table 4 – Postoperative characteristics.

Experience and trials (such as PROTECT-AF, PRE- VAIL) suggest that Watchman is not inferior to permanent anticoagulation in thromboembolic event prevention and is associated with less frequent bleeding complications than permanent anticoagulation. However, percutaneous devices are associated with a clinically signiﬁcant rate of serious periprocedural complications and are suitable for only a well- deﬁned group of patients with suitable anatomy. Implantation was considered as successful also if residual peri-device ﬂow (endoleak) existed but the jet width was below 5 mm, what could be prothrombogenic issue in patients' future life. In the interventional group was described high rate of periprocedural complications [18]. Other less frequently used devices for percutaneous LAA occlusion are Amplatzer [19] or Lariat using hybrid, percuta- neous and epicardial approach for ligation of LAA [20]. There are still some controversies about the type of AF and the risk of stroke. Several randomized and observational studies had documented a similar risk of thromboembolic events in patients with paroxysmal and persistent AF [21–24]. In contrast, other studies have shown that the risk of thromboembolism is lower in anticoagulated patients with paroxysmal AF than in those with persistent AF [25,26]. All of these results should be adjusted to the risk proﬁle of patients which is expressed, for example, by CHA2DS2-VASc score. We also have to comment on the patients with insufﬁcient perioperative implantation in our study. In two patients the AtriClip was positioned distally due to non-ideal anatomy (appendage with more than one part – ‘‘cauliﬂower anatomy’’). The third patient (9th patient) had a residual pouch of 18 mm, with no evidence of a thrombus formation. All of the patients, as well as all the remaining patients, had complete appendage occlusion distally from the positioned AtriClip without any leak, conﬁrmed by TEE or CT scan. The implantation of the AtriClip is now routinely performed under TEE guidance, which will probably exclude situations with insufﬁcient positioning resulting with a residual stump of the LAA, as previously described [27]. We have to comment on the limitations of the study. It is a single center observational study without any control group. The reason is that the occlusion of the LAA is an important part of the MAZE procedure and all surgeons have followed this protocol. Conclusion In our study the AtriClip implantation was associated with no periprocedural complications and no thrombus formation on the endocardial side of occluded LAA. The AtriClip represents an effective and safe tool for occlusion of the LAA during on- pump or off-pump AF surgery.

In a one-time procedure, the WATCHMAN Implant effectively reduces the risk of stroke in people with atrial fibrillation not caused by a heart valve problem. Why the WATCHMAN Implant 1 Over 1/3 of people with AFib feel trapped between the fear of having a stroke and fear of the risks associated with blood thinners. In fact, more than 4 in 5 people with AFib taking a blood thinner (83%) say they would be willing to try a different treatment to help reduce their risk of stroke. As a permanent procedure, the WATCHMAN Implant doesn’t come with the same bleeding risks associated with the long-term use of blood thinners. This makes it an important option for people with a history or risk of serious bleeding on blood thinners. 2 3 If you have atrial fibrillation and you take a blood thinner to reduce your stroke risk, you’re probably aware of the bleeding risks that come with your medication. The longer you’re on blood thinners, the more you’re at risk for a bleeding episode. Hear about these real people who had serious bleeding events while taking blood thinners. In the following videos, they talk about their experiences, the effects on their families, and why their doctors recommended the WATCHMAN Implant.

You may also be a candidate for the WATCHMAN Implant if you have a lifestyle or condition that increases your risk for serious bleeding. Certain lifestyles or conditions may increase your bleeding risk by putting you at higher risk for falls or making you prone to injury in other ways. Talk to your cardiologist about your risk.

DEVICE DESCRIPTION The WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure (LAAC) Technology is intended for percutaneous, transcatheter closure of the left atrial appendage and consists of the WATCHMAN Access System (Access Sheath and Dilator) and WATCHMAN Delivery System (Delivery Catheter and WATCHMAN Device). The Access System and Delivery System permit device placement in the left atrial appendage (LAA) via femoral venous access and inter-atrial septum crossing into the left atrium. The WATCHMAN Device is a self-expanding nitinol structure with a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) porous membrane on the proximal face. The device is constrained within the Delivery System until deployment in the LAA. The device is available in 5 sizes from 21 to 33 mm. Appropriate device sizing is determined by LAA measurements using fluoroscopy (fluoro) and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). The WATCHMAN Device is designed to be permanently implanted at or slightly distal to the ostium (opening) of the LAA to close the appendage to inflow. The placement procedure can be done under local or general anesthesia in a hospital cardiac catheterization or electrophysiology laboratory setting. User Information Intended users of the WATCHMAN Device are physicians who are trained in percutaneous and transseptal procedures and who have completed the WATCHMAN Physician Training program.\f2 Boston Scientific (Master Brand DFU Template 8.2677in x 11.6929in A4, 90105918AP), eDFU, MB, WATCHMAN, DEVICE, en, 90746221-01C Black (K) ∆E ≤5.0 Implantation of the WATCHMAN® Device should only be performed by these Intended Users. Contents Quantity \u0007 Description 1\t\u0007 WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure Device with Delivery System INTENDED USE/INDICATIONS FOR USE The WATCHMAN Device is indicated to reduce the risk of thromboembolism from the left atrial appendage in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who: • Are at increased risk for stroke and systemic embolism based on CHADS2 or CHA2 DS2 -VASc1 scores and are recommended for anticoagulation therapy; • Are deemed by their physicians to be suitable for warfarin; and • Have an appropriate rationale to seek a non-pharmacologic alternative to warfarin, taking into account the safety and effectiveness of the device compared to warfarin. CONTRAINDICATIONS Do not use the WATCHMAN Device if: • Intracardiac thrombus is visualized by echocardiographic imaging. • An atrial septal defect repair or closure device or a patent foramen ovale repair or closure device is present. • The LAA anatomy will not accommodate a device.See Table 46. • Any of the customary contraindications for other percutaneous catheterization procedures (e.g., patient size too small to accommodate TEE probe or required catheters) or conditions (e.g., active infection, bleeding disorder) are present. • There are contraindications to the use of warfarin, aspirin, or clopidogrel. • The patient has a known hypersensitivity to any portion of the device material or the individual components (see Device Description section) such that the use of the WATCHMAN Device is contraindicated. WARNINGS • Device selection should be based on accurate LAA measurements obtained using fluoro and ultrasound guidance (TEE recommended) in multiple angles (e.g., 0º, 45º, 90º, 135º). • Do not release the WATCHMAN Device from the core wire if the device does not meet all release criteria (see step 14). • If thrombus is observed on the device, warfarin therapy is recommended until resolution of thrombus is demonstrated by TEE. • The potential for device embolization exists with cardioversion <30 days following device implantation. Verify device position post-cardioversion during this period. • Administer appropriate endocarditis prophylaxis for 6 months following device implantation. The decision to continue endocarditis prophylaxis beyond 6 months is at physician discretion. • For single use only. Do not reuse, reprocess or resterilize. Reuse, reprocessing or resterilization may compromise the structural integrity of the device and/or lead to device failure which, in turn, may result in patient injury, illness or death. Reuse, reprocessing or resterilization may also create a risk of contamination of the device and/or cause patient infection or cross-infection, including, but not limited to, the transmission of infectious disease(s) from one patient to another. Contamination of the device may lead to injury, illness or death of the patient. PRECAUTIONS • The safety and effectiveness (and benefit-risk profile) of the WATCHMAN Device has not been established in patients for whom long-term anticoagulation is determined to be contraindicated. • The LAA is a thin-walled structure. Use caution when accessing the LAA and deploying the device. • Use caution when introducing the WATCHMAN Access System to prevent damage to cardiac structures. • Use caution when introducing the Delivery System to prevent damage to cardiac structures. • To prevent damage to the Delivery Catheter or device, do not allow the WATCHMAN Device to protrude beyond the distal tip of the Delivery Catheter when inserting the Delivery System into the Access Sheath. • If using a power injector, the maximum pressure should not exceed 100 psi. • In view of the concerns that were raised by the RE-ALIGN2 study of dabigatran in the presence of prosthetic mechanical heart valves, caution should be used when prescribing oral anticoagulants other than warfarin in patients treated with the WATCHMAN Device. The WATCHMAN Device has only been evaluated with the use of warfarin post-device implantation. PATIENT SELECTION FOR TREATMENT In considering the use of the WATCHMAN Device, the rationale for seeking analternativetolong-termwarfarintherapyandthesafetyandeffectiveness of the device compared to warfarin should be taken into account. See “Patient Counseling Information,” “Summary of Primary Clinical Studies,” and “Clinical Studies,” sections for additional information. Non-valvular atrial fibrillation is associated with an increased risk of cardioembolic stroke. However, there are many sources of thromboembolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. The WATCHMAN Device is designed to reduce the risk of thromboembolism originating from the LAA. Although thromboembolism from the LAA is a common source of stroke in this setting, it is not the sole source. Therefore, the WATCHMAN Device would not be expected to reduce the risk of ischemic stroke unrelated to cardioembolism from the LAA, and other potential risk factors for stroke should be considered (e.g., cerebrovascular disease, hypercoagulable states). Warfarin and other approved oral anticoagulants effectively reduce the risk of cardioembolic stroke and are the most commonly used treatments in at-risk patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Following a careful assessment of the safety and effectiveness of the available approved oral anticoagulants, the WATCHMAN Device is an option that may be considered in selected patients to reduce the risk of cardioembolism from the LAA. Selection among available treatment options must first take into account whether anticoagulation is indicated to reduce the risk of stroke based on CHADS2 or CHA2 DS2 -VASc scores. Next, in a patient who is deemed by their physicians to be suitable for anticoagulation with warfarin, physicians and patients should consider the rationale for implantation of the WATCHMAN Device as an alternative to long-term warfarin therapy. Specific factors may include one or more of the following: • A history of major bleeding while taking therapeutic anticoagulation therapy. • The patient’s prior experience with oral anticoagulation (if applicable), which may include an inability to maintain a stable therapeutic International Normalized Ratio (INR) or inability to comply with regular INR monitoring AND unavailability of an approved alternative anticoagulation agent. • A medical condition, occupation, or lifestyle placing the patient at high risk of major bleeding secondary to trauma. Some studies of patients with a history of falls, or at risk for falls and head trauma, have shown that the benefits of anticoagulation therapy to reduce the risk of stroke outweigh the risk of major, life-threatening bleeding. An individualized benefit and risk assessment should be made in such patients.3, 4, 5 • The presence of indication(s) for long-term warfarin use, other than non-valvular atrial fibrillation (e.g. mechanical heart valve, hypercoagulable states, recurrent deep venous thrombosis). Details regarding the indications, contraindications, warnings and precautions for warfarin and other oral anticoagulants approved for patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation are provided in their respective Instructions for Use. Of note: • The safety and effectiveness (and benefit-risk profile) of the WATCHMAN Device has been compared to warfarin and not to other oral anticoagulants that have been approved for patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. • The safety and effectiveness (and benefit-risk profile) of the WATCHMAN Device has not been established in patients for whom long-term anticoagulation is determined to be contraindicated. Specific factors that need to be considered for the WATCHMAN Device and implantation procedure include the following: • Overall medical status, including conditions which might preclude the safety of a percutaneous, transcatheter procedure. • Suitability for percutaneous, trans-septal procedures, including considerations of: • Cardiac anatomy relating to the LAA size and shape. • Vascular access anatomy (e.g., femoral vein size, thrombus, or tortuosity.) • Ability of the patient to tolerate general or local anesthesia. • Ability of the patient to undergo required imaging. • Ability to comply with the recommended post-WATCHMAN Device implant pharmacologic regimen, especially for patients at high risk for bleeding, i.e., the need for warfarin plus aspirin for at least 45 days post-device implantation, clopidogrel and aspirin through 6 months post-procedure, and aspirin indefinitely. PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Physicians should review the following information when counseling patients about the WATCHMAN Device and implant procedure: • The safety and effectiveness of systemic anticoagulation and localized percutaneous, LAA closure with the WATCHMAN Device • There are non-LAA sources of cardiac emboli and other etiologies of stroke that may result in ischemic stroke independent of LAA closure that should be considered. • The procedural risks associated with WATCHMAN Device implantation. Table 4 details the major clinical events related to the device or procedure as observed in the WATCHMAN clinical trial program. • The need for adherence to a defined pharmacologic regimen of warfarin and antiplatelet therapy following WATCHMAN Device implant • Clinical conditions may arise that require continuation or resumption of warfarin therapy following WATCHMAN Device implantation • The risk of the device implantation procedure plus post- procedure related bleeding weighed against the risk of bleeding on long-term warfarin therapy Additional counseling information can be found in the Patient Guide and in the clinical studies section of these Directions for Use. MR MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING Non-clinical testing demonstrated that the WATCHMAN Device is MR Conditional.Apatientwiththedevicecanbescannedsafely,immediately after placement of this implant, under the following conditions: • Static magnetic fields of 3.0 Tesla or 1.5 Tesla • Spatial gradient field of 2500 Gauss/cm or less • The maximum whole body averaged specific absorption rate (SAR) shall be limited to 2.0 W/kg (normal operating mode only) for 15 minutes of scanning • Normal operating mode of the MRI scanner The WATCHMAN Device should not migrate in this MRI environment. This device has not been evaluated to determine if it is MR Conditional beyond these parameters. 3.0 Tesla Temperature Information In non-clinical testing, the WATCHMAN Device produced a temperature rise of <1.1 °C at a maximum MR system-reported SAR of 2.0 W/kg as measured by calorimetry for 15 minutes of continuous MR scanning in a 3.0 Tesla MR system (Excite, Software G3.0-052B, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI). These calculations do not take into consideration the cooling effects of blood flow. 1.5 Tesla Temperature Information Non-clinical testing of RF-induced heating in the WATCHMAN Device was performed at 64 MHz in a 1.5 Tesla whole body coil MR scanner (Intera, Software Release 10.6.2.4, 2006-03-10, Philips Medical Systems, Andover, MA) and produced a temperature rise of <1.5 °C at an MR extrapolated SAR of 2.0 W/kg for 15 minutes of continuous MR scanning. These calculations do not take into consideration the cooling effects of blood flow. Image Artifact Information In non-clinical testing, the image artifact caused by the device extends less than 3 mm from the WATCHMAN Device when imaged with a spin echo pulse sequence and a 3-Tesla MRI system. The image artifact caused by the device extends less than 5mm from the WATCHMAN Device when imaged with a gradient echo pulse sequence and a 3-Tesla MRI system. MR image quality may be compromised if the area of interest is relatively close to the WATCHMAN Device. Optimization of MR imaging parameters is recommended. SUMMARY OF PRIMARY CLINICAL STUDIES Treatment with the WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure (LAAC) Device, a permanent implant intended to reduce the risk of thromboembolism from the LAA, was evaluated in subjects with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who are suitable for warfarin therapy. The pivotal WATCHMAN LAAC Therapy for Embolic PROTECTion in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation (PROTECT AF) study was followed by three additional studies in this population: a continued access (CAP) registry to the PROTECT AF study; and a second randomized study, the Prospective Randomized Evaluation of the WATCHMAN LAAC Device in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation Versus Long Term Warfarin Therapy (PREVAIL) study; and a continued access (CAP2) registry to the PREVAIL study. These four studies enrolled subjects that were deemed by their physicians to be suitable for warfarin, and warfarin was used in the post-procedure during the period of tissue coverage of the device.

A total of 461 subjects at 41 U.S. investigational sites were enrolled from November 2010 through June 2012. The 461 subjects included 269 subjects randomized to the WATCHMAN Device group, 138 subjects randomized to the Control group, and 54 Roll-in WATCHMAN Device subjects. CAP Registry The CAP registry is a multi-center prospective non-randomized study allowing continued access to the WATCHMAN Device during regulatory review of the pre-market application for the WATCHMAN Device. Entry criteria were the same as the PROTECT AF study. A total of 26 centers (24 U.S., 2 European) actively participated by enrolling at least one subject in the study. A total of 566 subjects were enrolled from August 2008 through June 2010. The primary effectiveness and safety endpoints were similar to the PROTECT AF. CAP2 Registry The CAP2 registry is a multi-center prospective non-randomized study allowing continued access to the WATCHMAN Device during regulatory review of the pre-market application for the WATCHMAN Device. Entry criteria were the same as the PREVAIL study. A total of 579 subjects at 47 U.S. investigational sites were enrolled from September 2012 through March 2014. The primary effectiveness and safety endpoints were similar to the PREVAIL study.

CLINICAL STUDIES PROTECT AF Study Primary Objective: To demonstrate that the WATCHMAN Device is safe and effective in subjects with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who are deemed by their physicians to be suitable for warfarin therapy to prevent thromboembolism from the LAA. Design: The PROTECT AF study was a multi-center prospective randomized controlled trial comparing the WATCHMAN Device to long-term warfarin therapy. A 2:1 randomization allocation ratio (two Device subjects to one Control subject) was used with stratification by center. Main entry criteria included, but were not limited to, at least 18 years of age, non-valvular atrial fibrillation, a CHADS2 score of 1 or greater, and eligibility for long-term warfarin therapy. Following randomization,subjectswereassessedat45days,6,9,12monthsand semi-annually thereafter through 5 years. A non-randomized roll-in phase was added to permit physicians to become experienced with the WATCHMAN Device implant procedure. Subjects randomized to receive the WATCHMAN Device underwent TEE at 45 days, 6 and 12 months after successful implantation. Subjects randomized to the Control group were to remain on warfarin with INR monitored every other week through 6 months and monthly thereafter. The primary effectiveness endpoint was the rate of the composite of stroke (including ischemic and hemorrhagic), systemic embolism, cardiovascular death (cardiovascular and unexplained). The primary safety endpoint was rate of life-threatening events, which included events such as device embolization requiring retrieval, bleeding events such as pericardial effusion requiring drainage, cranial bleeding events due to any source, gastrointestinal bleeds requiring transfusion and any bleeding related to the device or procedure that necessitates an operation. The effectiveness event rate was defined as the number of events per 100 pt-yrs of follow-up. A Bayesian Poisson-Gamma model stratified by CHADS2 score was used for evaluation of the statistical objective. The first sequential interim analysis was performed after collection of 600 pt-yrs of follow-up, which included 300 subjects with one year of follow-up and 100 subjects with two years of follow-up. Subsequent analyses were allowed after each additional 150 pt-yrs up to a maximum of 1500 pt-yrs of follow-up. The criterion for establishing non-inferiority at an interim analysis required that the posterior probability that the primary effectiveness event rate for the WATCHMAN group being less than 2 times the event rate for the Control group be at least 0.975 (or equivalently, the upper bound of the equitailed 2-sided 95% credible interval for the rate ratio be less than 2). Enrollment: The study enrolled 800 subjects with 707 randomized and the remaining 93 participating in the WATCHMAN Roll-in group. Of the 707 randomized subjects, 463 were assigned to the WATCHMAN group and 244 assigned to the warfarin control group as shown in Table 5. Table 5.

The primary effectiveness event rate was 2.2 events per 100 patient years for the Device group and 3.7 events per 100 patient years for the Control group, resulting in a relative risk or rate ratio of 0.61. The criterion for non-inferiority and superiority of the WATCHMAN Device vs. the Control group were met and were driven by the rates of hemorrhagic stroke and cardiovascular or unexplained death in favor of the Device group.

PREVAIL Study Primary Objective: To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the WATCHMAN Device in subjects with atrial fibrillation who are deemed by their physicians to be suitable for long term warfarin therapy. Design: The PREVAIL study was a multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled study comparing the WATCHMAN Device to long-term warfarin therapy. A 2:1 randomization allocation ratio (two Device subjects to one Control subject) was used with stratification by center. Subjects were eligible to participate in PREVAIL if they were at least 18 years of age, had non-valvular atrial fibrillation and were eligible for long-term warfarin therapy with a CHADS2 score of at least 2. Subjects with a CHADS2 score of 1 were also permitted to enroll if they had any of the following characteristics (consistent with the recommendations presented in the ACC/AHA/ESC 2006 Guidelines for the Management of Patients with Atrial Fibrillation): • The subject was female age 75 or older. • The subject had a baseline LVEF ≥30% and <35%. • The subject was age 65-74 and had diabetes or coronary artery disease. • The subject was age 65 or greater and had documented congestive heart failure. A roll-in phase permitted physicians to gain experience with the WATCHMAN implant procedure. Subjects randomized to receive the WATCHMAN Device underwent TEE at 45 days, 6 and 12 months after successful device implantation. Subjects randomized to the Control group were to remain on warfarin with INR monitoring every other week through 6 months and monthly thereafter. All randomized subjects underwent follow-up at 45 days, 6, 9, and 12 months, semiannually through 3 years and annually thereafter through 5 years. This study had three primary endpoints: • First primary endpoint: The 18-month rates of the composite of stroke (including hemorrhagic or ischemic), systemic embolism, and cardiovascular or unexplained death. The non-inferiority success criterion for the WATCHMAN group vs. the control group was a rate ratio of less than 1.75 with posterior probability of at least 97.5% (or equivalently that the upper bound of the equitailed 2-sided 95% credible interval for the 18-month rate ratio would be less than 1.75). • Second primary endpoint: The 18-month rates of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism excluding the first 7 days post-randomization. The non-inferiority success criterion for the WATCHMAN group vs. the control group was either: (1) a rate ratio of less than 2.0, or (2) a rate difference of less than 0.0275, each with a posterior probability of at least 97.5% (or equivalently that (1) the upper bound of the equitailed 2-sided 95% credible interval for the 18-month rate ratio would be less than 2.0 or (2) the upper bound of the equitailed 2-sided 95% credible interval for the 18-month rate difference would be less than 0.0275). • Third primary endpoint: The percentage of WATCHMAN subjects that experienced one of the following events between the time of randomization and within 7 days of the procedure or by hospital discharge, whichever was later: all-cause death, ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, or device or procedure-related events requiring open cardiac surgery or major endovascular intervention such as pseudoaneurysm repair, AV fistula repair, or other major endovascular repair. The following events were not included in the assessment of this endpoint: percutaneous catheter drainage of pericardial effusions, snaring of an embolized device, thrombin injection to treat a femoral pseudoaneurysm, and non-surgical treatments of access site complications. The third primary endpoint event rate was compared to a performance goal of 2.67%.\f7 Boston Scientific (Master Brand DFU Template 8.2677in x 11.6929in A4, 90105918AP), eDFU, MB, WATCHMAN, DEVICE, en, 90746221-01C Black (K) ∆E ≤5.0 A Bayesian approach based on a piecewise exponential model was used to evaluate the first and second primary endpoints based on time to first event. In addition, this approach included prior PROTECT AF historical data from subjects with the same CHADS2 enrollment criteria as the PREVAIL subjects (see Table 3, PREVAIL Key Eligibility Criteria) with a discounting weight of 50%. For the third primary endpoint, a Bayesian approach based on a beta-binomial model was used to incorporate historical data from the PROTECT AF study and CAP registry through a prior distribution (without discounting) from subjects with the same CHADS2 score enrollment criteria as the PREVAIL subjects. Enrollment: The study enrolled 461 subjects with 407 randomized and the remaining 54 participating in the WATCHMAN® Roll-in group. Of the 407 randomized subjects, 269 were assigned to the WATCHMAN group and 138 assigned to the warfarin control group as shown in Table 13. Table 13.

There were two analyses of the PREVAIL trial results: (1) a pre-specified dataset lock in January 2013 and (2) an updated dataset lock in June 2014. The term “PREVAIL Only” refers to data from subjects enrolled in the PREVAIL study without the prior PROTECT AF study information used in the Bayesian analysis. The pre-specified analyses were based on the data available at 6 months following the completion of enrollment. When this was achieved in the January 2013 dataset, the PREVAIL Only subject mean follow-up post-randomization was 11.8±5.8 months, and 113 of 407 (28%) randomized subjects reached or passed the window for their 18-month follow-up visit. As shown in Table 17, this dataset included 396.2 PREVAIL Only patient- years, whereas the discounted prior data borrowed from PROTECT AF included 618.8 patient-years. In the updated June 2014 dataset, the mean follow-up duration for PREVAIL Only subjects was 25.9±9.7 months, and all randomized subjects reached or passed the window for their 18-month follow-up visit [and 310 randomized subjects (76%) reached or passed the window for their 24-month follow-up visit]. The updated dataset follow- up duration for PREVAIL Only subjects increased to 860.3 patient-years.\f8 Boston Scientific (Master Brand DFU Template 8.2677in x 11.6929in A4, 90105918AP), eDFU, MB, WATCHMAN, DEVICE, en, 90746221-01C Black (K) ∆E ≤5.0 Table 17.

The Bayesian estimate for the 18-month rate ratio was 1.07 with a 95% credible interval of 0.57 to 1.89. Since the upper bound of 1.89 was not lower than the non-inferiority margin of 1.75 defined in the statistical analysis plan, the non-inferiority criterion was not met (the posterior probability of non-inferiority was 95.69%). In the June 2014 Bayesian analysis, the 18-month rate was 0.065 for the Device group and 0.057 for the Control group. The Bayesian estimate for the 18-month rate ratio was 1.21 with a 95% credible interval of 0.69 to 2.05. Since the upper bound of 2.05 was not lower than the non-inferiority margin of 1.75 defined in the statistical analysis plan, the non-inferiority criterion was not met (the posterior probability of non- inferiority was 92.6%).

These studies were not prospectively powered for subgroup analyses, and these analyses should be considered to be exploratory. No statistically significant interactions were detected by sex, age, or baseline CHADS2 score. Results by race were not performed due to the small sample sizes. Table 26.

Design: The CAP registry is a multi-center prospective non-randomized study allowing continued access to the WATCHMAN Device during regulatory review of the pre-market application for the WATCHMAN Device. Up to 30 investigative centers with prior WATCHMAN Device experience in the PROTECT AF study were allowed to participate. Study participants were required to be at least 18 years of age with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, have a CHADS2 score of 1 or greater, and be eligible for long-term warfarin therapy. Following baseline evaluation and device implantation, subjects were seen at 45 days, 6, 9, and 12 months and semi-annually thereafter through 5 years. The endpoints of the CAP registry were identical to those in the PROTECT AF study, but there were no pre-defined statistical hypotheses. The primary effectiveness endpoint was the rate of the composite of stroke (including ischemic and hemorrhagic), systemic embolism, and cardiovascular death (cardiovascular or unexplained). The primary safety endpoint was the rate of life-threatening events as determined by the CEC, which included device embolization requiring retrieval, bleeding events such as pericardial effusion requiring drainage, cranial bleeding events due to any source, gastrointestinal bleeding requiring transfusion, and any bleeding related to the device or procedure that necessitated a surgical procedure. Enrollment: A total of 26 centers (24 U.S., 2 European) participated by enrolling at least one subject. A total of 566 subjects were enrolled. The average CHADS2 score was 2.5±1.2, the mean CHA2 DS2 -VASc score was 3.9±1.5, the mean age was 74 years, and 66% of subjects were male as shown in Tables 28 and 29. Table 28.

Serious adverse events related to the WATCHMAN Device or implant procedure are provided in Table 4. Device. Up to 60 investigative centers with prior WATCHMAN experience in the PROTECT AF or PREVAIL study were allowed to participate. Study participants were required to be at least 18 years of age with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, be eligible for long-term warfarin therapy, and have a CHADS2 score of at least 2. Subjects with a CHADS2 score of 1 were also permitted to enroll if they had any of the following characteristics (consistent with the recommendations presented in the ACC/AHA/ESC 2006 Guidelines for the Management of Patients with Atrial Fibrillation): • The subject was female age 75 or older. • The subject had a baseline LVEF ≥30% and <35%. • The subject was age 65-74 and had diabetes or coronary artery disease. • The subject was age 65 or greater and had documented congestive heart failure. Following baseline evaluation and device implantation, subjects were seen at 45 days, 6 and 12 months, semi-annually through 3 years and annually thereafter through 5 years. The endpoints of the CAP2 registry were similar to those used in the PREVAIL study, but there were no pre-defined statistical hypotheses. There were three primary endpoints (two effectiveness and one safety) as follows: 1) the rate of the composite of stroke (including hemorrhagic and ischemic), systemic embolism, and cardiovascular or unexplained death; 2) the rate of the composite of ischemic stroke and systemic embolism, excluding events occurring in the first 7 days following device implantation; and 3) the occurrence of all-cause mortality, ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, or device or procedure related events requiring open cardiac surgery or major endovascular intervention between the time of randomization and 7 days of the procedure or by hospital discharge, whichever was later. Demographics: A total of 47 U.S. investigational sites actively participated by enrolling at least one subject in the study. A total of 579 subjects were enrolled. The average CHADS2 score was 2.7±1.1, the mean CHA2 DS2 -VASc score was 4.5±1.3, the mean age was 75 years, and 61% of subjects were male as shown in Tables 35 and 36. Table 35.

OPERATIONAL INSTRUCTIONS Pre-procedural Instructions A baseline TEE should be performed to verify that a patient’s anatomy is appropriate for a WATCHMAN® Device to be implanted. 1. Assess the following through multiple imaging planes (0°, 45°, 90° and 135° sweep): • LAA size/shape, number of lobes in LAA, and location of lobes relative to the ostium. • Confirm the absence of thrombus (use Color Doppler and echo contrast as necessary). 2. Record LAA ostium and LAA length measurements (0°, 45°, 90° and 135° sweep). Measure the LAA ostium at approximately these angles: • at 0° measure from coronary artery marker to a point 2 cm from tip of the “limbus” • at 45° measure from top of the mitral valve annulus to a point 2 cm from tip of the “limbus” • at 90° measure from top of the mitral valve annulus to a point 2 cm from tip of the “limbus” • at 135° measure from top of the mitral valve annulus to a point 2 cm from tip of the “limbus” Measured maximum LAA ostium width must be ≥17 mm or ≤31 mm to accommodate available device sizes. Note: The maximum LAA ostium and LAA depth measurements determine device size selection. Procedural Instructions Equipment Needed for Implantation Procedure • Venous Introducer (optional) • Standard transseptal access system • 0.035 in guidewire (exchange length extra support) • 5F or 6F Angiographic Pigtail Catheter • WATCHMAN Access System (which includes the Access Sheath and Dilator) Implantation Procedure Note: Aspirin should be started one day prior to scheduled procedure and continued daily. Note: Use of fluoroscopy and echocardiographic imaging should be used when implanting the device (TEE is recommended as an aid in placing the WATCHMAN Device). Note: Patients should be fully heparinized throughout the procedure with a recommended minimum activated clotting time (ACT) of 200-300 seconds recorded after transseptal puncture. 1. Use standard percutaneous techniques to puncture femoral vein and insert 0.035 in guidewire and vessel dilator. Use a standard, commercially available transseptal access system to cross inter-atrial septum. 2. Exchange crossing sheath with exchange length extra support 0.035 in guidewire. Position guidewire in left upper pulmonary vein (LUPV) or loop in left atrium. 3. Prepare WATCHMAN Access System. Note: Inspect sterile package and WATCHMAN Access System prior to use. If sterile barrier, labeling, packaging, or device have been compromised in any way, DO NOT USE. A. Remove Access Sheath and Dilator from package under sterile conditions. B. Inspect prior to use to ensure no damage. C. Flush Access Sheath and Dilator with sterile saline prior to use. D. Insert Dilator into hemostasis valve of Access Sheath until the two snap together. Note: Do not tighten the hemostasis valve while the Dilator is inserted in the WATCHMAN Access System. The Dilator by itself will occlude the lumen of the WATCHMAN Access System creating hemostasis. Tightening the valve onto the Dilator may damage the valve threads, which can lead to subsequent difficulty in closing the valve and an incomplete seal, once the Dilator is removed. 4. Advance WATCHMAN Access System over guidewire into left atrium (LA). As Access Sheath nears center of LA, unsnap the Access Sheath from the Dilator, hold Dilator and advance Access Sheath into initial position in LA or ostium of LUPV. Precaution: Use caution when introducing WATCHMAN Access System to prevent damage to cardiac structures. 5. Remove Dilator and guidewire, leaving Access Sheath in LA or LUPV. Allow back bleed to minimize potential for introducing air before tightening valve. Flush the Access Sheath with saline. If continued back bleed is observed from the valve after the Dilator is removed despite attempting to close it, loosen the valve cap (counter-clockwise rotation) until the cap spins freely. Then re- attempt closure of the valve while exerting gentle forward pressure on the valve cap during closure (clockwise rotation) to ensure proper engagement of the valve thread. While these steps are being undertaken, manual occlusion of the valve opening using a gloved finger is recommended to minimize blood loss. Note: These steps may be repeated if necessary. However, if this does not mitigate the blood leak, the user should remove and replace the WATCHMAN Access Sheath before proceeding with the procedure. 6. Confirm LAA size and select appropriate WATCHMAN Device. A. Using ultrasound guidance (TEE recommended), measure LAA ostium width and LAA depth in 4 views (0°, 45°, 90°, 135°). B. Choose a device based on maximum LAA ostium width recorded. The LAA depth must be at least as long as the LAA ostium width. Use Table 46 as a guide. Note: LAA anatomy should accommodate a WATCHMAN Device as described in Table 46. Table 46. WATCHMAN Device Selection Max LAA Ostium (mm) Device Size (mm) 17 – 19 21 20 – 22 24 23 – 25 27 26 – 28 30 29 – 31 33 Note: Record multiple angles on cine with contrast prior to advancing Access Sheath into LAA. Use fluoro guidance while advancing pigtail catheter and while advancing the Access Sheath. Stop if resistance is felt. C. Carefully advance pigtail catheter through Access Sheath into distal portion of the LAA under fluoro guidance. Carefully advance Access Sheath over pigtail catheter until Access Sheath radiopaque (RO) marker band corresponding to device size (see Figure 4) is at or just distal to LAA ostium. Slowly remove pigtail catheter. Distal Marker Band 33 mm 27 mm 24 mm 30 mm 21 mm Figure 4. WATCHMAN Device Size Relative to Access Sheath Marker Bands 7. Prepare WATCHMAN Delivery System A. Remove Delivery System under sterile conditions. B. Inspect prior to use to ensure no damage to handle, catheter connections and device (through Delivery System). Note: If sterile barrier, labeling, packaging, or device have been compromised in any way, or Delivery System appears damaged DO NOT USE. C. Confirm that the distal tip of the device is aligned with the RO marker band on Delivery System. D. Flush Delivery System with saline removing all air and maintaining fluid throughout system. Open and flush proximal valve. Note: To avoid introducing air, apply pressurized saline bag to the side port of the Access Sheath, or submerge Access Sheath hub in saline. Saline may be dripped from Delivery System during introduction into Access Sheath by injecting through flush port. 8. Loosen hemostasis valve of Access Sheath allowing bleed back before inserting Delivery System. Note: Hemostasis valve should spin freely (fully open). Note: Tightening the valve onto the WATCHMAN Delivery System may damage the valve threads, which can lead to subsequent difficulty in closing the valve and an incomplete seal, once the WATCHMAN Delivery System is removed. 9. To avoid introduction of air, slowly advance Delivery System into Access Sheath under fluoro guidance. Precaution: Use caution when introducing Delivery System to prevent damage to cardiac structures. 10. Under fluoroscopic guidance, align the most distal marker band on the Delivery System with most distal marker band on Access Sheath. Once marker bands are aligned, stabilize Delivery System, retract Access Sheath and snap together as Access Sheath/Delivery System assembly. 11. Using fluoro and ultrasound imaging (TEE recommended) confirm position of Delivery System tip before deploying the device. Note: To inject contrast, a syringe or manifold must be attached to flush port of Delivery System. Precaution: If using a power injector, the maximum pressure should not exceed 100 psi. 12. If repositioning is required, unsnap the Delivery System from the Access Sheath and slowly remove Delivery System from Access Sheath. If necessary reinsert pigtail catheter to reposition Access Sheath. Reinsert Delivery System as described in Steps 9 and 10. 13. Deploy WATCHMAN Device by loosening valve on Delivery System and holding deployment knob stationary while retracting the Access Sheath/Delivery System assembly to completely deploy Device. Leave core wire attached. 14. Device release criteria: A. Position: Plane of maximum diameter is at or just distal to and spans the entire LAA ostium (See Figure 5). Figure 5. WATCHMAN Device Position and Size B. Anchor: Gently pull back then release deployment knob to visualize movement of device and LAA together. C. Size (compression): Measure plane of maximum diameter of device (See Figure 5). Use Table 47 as a guide. D. Seal: Ensure all lobes are distal to device and sealed, i.e., ≤5 mm jet Table 47.

Resistance will\f14 Boston Scientific (Master Brand DFU Template 8.2677in x 11.6929in A4, 90105918AP), eDFU, MB, WATCHMAN, DEVICE, en, 90746221-01C Black (K) ∆E ≤5.0 be felt as device shoulders collapse. Continue to advance assembly up to but not past fixation anchors. When resistance is felt a second time (anchor contact), stop, tighten hemostasis valve. Note: If device is retrieved past fixation anchors, recapture fully and replace Delivery System with a new system. Refer to Step 16. The WATCHMAN® Device and Delivery System are for single use only. Do not reuse or resterilize. B. Reposition Access Delivery/System assembly proximally and re-deploy by holding deployment knob and retracting Access Sheath until device is completely deployed. Leave core wire attached. Warning: Do not release the WATCHMAN Device from the core wire if the device does not meet release criteria (Step 14). 16. Full device recapture. Note: The WATCHMAN Device should be fully recaptured into the delivery system, removed and discarded if the device is deployed too proximal or does not meet the release criteria test. The WATCHMAN Device and Delivery System are for single use only. Do not reuse or resterilize the fully recaptured device. A. Advance tip of Access/Delivery System assembly up to face of device (do not unsnap). B. Fix deployment knob with right hand and gently advance Access/Delivery System assembly over shoulders of device. Position right thumb against Delivery System for stability. Resistance will be felt as device shoulders collapse. Continue to advance assembly until device is completely collapsed and fully recaptured (past anchors). C. Withdraw the device until distal anchors are proximal to the RO marker band, then tighten hemostasis valve. D. Unsnap Delivery System from Access Sheath while maintaining position. Slowly remove the entire Delivery System. E. Insert pigtail catheter to reposition Access Sheath in LAA if necessary. F. Repeat Steps 7-14 with new Delivery System. 17. WATCHMAN Device release criteria: Confirm proper Position, Anchor, Size, and Seal (PASS criteria), and then advance assembly to face of device. Rotate deployment knob counter clockwise 3-5 full turns. Confirm core wire is disconnected. 18. Remove Access Sheath and Delivery System based on parameters for hemostasis. 19. Use standard of care for post-procedure bleeding at access site. Post-procedure Information 1. Post-procedure warfarin therapy is required in ALL patients receiving a WATCHMAN Device. Patients should remain on 81-100 mg of aspirin and warfarin should be taken post-implant (INR 2.0-3.0). At 45 days (±15 days) post-implant, perform WATCHMAN Device assessment with TEE. Cessation of warfarin is at physician discretion provided that any peri-device flow demonstrated by TEE is ≤5 mm. If adequate seal is not demonstrated, subsequent warfarin cessation decisions are contingent on demonstrating flow ≤5 mm. At the time the patient ceases warfarin, the patient should begin clopidogrel 75 mg daily and increase aspirin dosage to 300-325 mg daily. This regimen should continue until 6 months have elapsed after implantation. Patients should then remain on aspirin 300-325 mg indefinitely. If a patient remains on warfarin and aspirin 81-100 mg for at least 6 months after implantation, and then ceases warfarin, the patient should not require clopidogrel, but should increase to aspirin 300- 325 mg daily, which should be taken indefinitely. Yes Yes Yes No No No *The Performance and timing of TEE to re-evaluate the LAA seal is left to physician discretion. 1 Day Prior to Implant Begin aspirin (81-100 mg) Implant Continue aspirin (81-100 mg) and add warfarin, adjusted to achieve INR of 2.0-3.0 until 45-day visit 45 Days Post-Implant Is LAA seal 5 mm? Cease warfarin and continue aspirin (300- 325 mg). Add Clopidigrel (75 mg) 6-Month Post-Implant Cease Clopidigrel (75 mg) and maintain aspirin (300- 325 mg) indefinitely Continue aspirin (81-100 mg) and warfarin, adjusted to achieve INR of 2.0-3.0 Reassess Seal* Is LAA seal 5 mm? Follow-Up Duration Has the patient been followed for at least 6-months post-implant with adequate seal? Follow-Up Duration Cease warfarin and increase aspirin (300-325 mg) Figure 6. WATCHMAN Device Implant Pharmacologic Regimen 2. At 45 days and 12 months: assess WATCHMAN Device with TEE. • Confirm absence of intra-cardiac thrombus. • Perform color Doppler assessment to include the device/ LAA border at the following approximate TEE angles (0°, 45°, 90° and 135°). Measure any residual leak around the device into the LAA. If there is evidence of an incomplete LAA orifice seal of >5 mm, continuing or restarting warfarin therapy is recommended. • If thrombus is observed on the device, warfarin therapy is recommended until resolution of thrombus is demonstrated by TEE. 3. Prescribe appropriate endocarditis prophylaxis for 6 months following device implantation. The decision to continue endocarditis prophylaxis beyond 6 months is at physician discretion.

          "context": "The one-time, minimally invasive procedure for people with non-valvular AFib who need an alternative to blood thinners. ONE TIME. FOR A LIFETIME. WELCOME TO WATCHMAN™\fMORE THAN 200,000 PEOPLE HAVE LEFT BLOOD THINNERS BEHIND WITH THE WATCHMAN™ IMPLANT. Non-valvular AFib can mean a lifetime of blood thinners. It can also mean a lifetime of worry about bleeds from falls, other medical issues, or an unexpected surgery. The WATCHMAN Implant procedure is a trusted alternative that permanently reduces both stroke risk and bleeding worry. With almost 20 years of clinical and real-world experience—including 10 clinical trials—it is proven to be safe and effective. Here’s what you’ll find inside this brochure. STROKE RISK REDUCTION OPTIONS WHAT THE WATCHMAN IMPLANT IS AND HOW IT WORKS BEFORE, DURING AND AFTER YOUR PROCEDURE LIVING LIFE WITH THE WATCHMAN IMPLANT HOW TO GET IN TOUCH WITH US Read on to learn more about the WATCHMAN Implant. When I was on blood thinners, it was always a different life. WATCHMAN was a lifesaver. It put me back to being who I was. —CLIFF, 68 3\fWhile some people may be able stop blood thinners immediately after the procedure, in a clinical trial 96% of people were able to discontinue their blood thinner 45 days after the WATCHMAN Implant.1 THE GOAL:REDUCING YOUR STROKE RISK. BLOOD THINNERS ARE ONE WAY. It’s a one time, minimally-invasive procedure that permanently reduces stroke risk without the worries that come with a lifetime of blood thinners. For some people, that means an extra measure of safety if they have bleeding due to certain medical conditions, such as an ulcer. For others, it means peace of mind should they need surgery. A more active lifestyle is also less risky, including travel that’s not near medical help. What about cost? While blood thinners must be taken every day for life and represent an ongoing cost, the WATCHMAN Implant is a one-time procedure and one-time cost. This means you can save you money over time. For example, the total out-of-pocket spending for the WATCHMAN Implant is lower than warfarin by year 2 and half the cost by year 5.2 Medicare covers the WATCHMAN Implant for people who meet certain coverage criteria and an increasing number of other insurers do too. Insurance coverage can vary significantly from one plan to another. Be sure to contact your insurance carrier for any specific questions. 1.

I was restricted on blood thinners and now I can just go to where I want to go and do what I want to do. —MICHAEL, 79 Major and minor bleeding risks from other medical conditions or falls Lifestyle activities that carry a risk of bleeding Difficulty with once or twice-daily pill dosing Complications during surgery High ongoing cost If taking warfarin, regular monitoring and food/drug interactions STROKE RISK REDUCTION OPTIONS Blood thinners are effective, but can come with challenges and potential bleeding worries. Blood thinners reduce the risk of clots that could lead to a stroke. The blood thinner warfarin (also known as Coumadin®) has been around for more than 60 years. There are also several newer blood thinners available now, including Eliquis® (apixaban), Pradaxa® (dabigatran), Xarelto® (rivaroxaban), and Savaysa® (edoxaban). Is the WATCHMAN Implant right for you? The WATCHMAN Implant is indicated for people who have AFib not caused by a heart valve problem (also known as non-valvular AFib), have been recommended for blood thinning medicines by their doctor but need an alternative. The WATCHMAN Implant may be right for you if: \u0007 You have a lifestyle, occupation, or health concern that puts you at risk for serious bleeding You’ve had serious bleeding while taking blood thinners You have difficulty taking blood thinners as prescribed by your doctor Talk to your cardiologist about the benefits and risks. Together, you’ll decide if the WATCHMAN Implant is right for you. THE WATCHMAN IMPLANT IS AN ALTERNATIVE TO BLOOD THINNERS. 5 4\fHow exactly does it work? To understand how the WATCHMAN Implant works, it helps to understand the connection between AFib and stroke. Atrial fibrillation, or AFib, affects your heart’s ability to pump blood normally. This can cause blood to pool in an area called the left atrial appendage, or LAA. There, blood cells can stick together and form a clot. When a blood clot escapes from the LAA and travels to another part of the body, it can cut off the blood supply to the brain, causing a stroke.1,2 On average, a person with AFib is 5 times more likely to suffer a stroke than someone with a regular heartbeat.3 In people with AFib not caused by a heart valve problem, more than 90% of stroke-causing clots that come from the heart are formed in the LAA.1 That’s why closing off this part of the heart is an effective way to reduce stroke risk. The WATCHMAN Implant fits right into your LAA. It’s designed to permanently close it off and keep those blood clots from escaping. Advanced, Heart-Friendly Design Science always looks for ways to make effective treatments even better. The WATCHMAN Implant is no exception. The WATCHMAN FLX Implant design is an advancement that enables the implant to fit a greater number of patients, giving more people than ever a safe, effective alternative to blood thinners should they need one.

The WATCHMAN Implant is a small, flexible implant about the size of a quarter. It is made from very light, compact materials commonly used in many other medical implants. It is placed into your heart during a minimally invasive procedure and never needs to be replaced. TAKING A CLOSER LOOK AT THE WATCHMAN™ IMPLANT. With WATCHMAN, I can forget about the concern of a stroke. I can forget about the concern of side effects from drugs and just try to live a happy, healthy life. —AJ, 68 6 7\fThe decision to get the WATCHMAN Implant is shared between you and your doctor. You’ll talk about what’s important to you, your goals, and the procedure’s risks and benefits. Together, you’ll decide whether the WATCHMAN Implant is the right choice for you. If so, here is what comes next. BEFORE GETTING READY. Get insurance approval. The WATCHMAN Implant is covered for eligible Medicare patients and does not require advance approval. If you have commercial insurance, you may need prior authorization from your plan. Your doctor’s office may be able to assist. Choose a medical center. You and your doctor will decide on a center. You can view options at watchman.com/centers, and your doctor will provide a referral. Typically, the medical center will call you to schedule a consultation, or your doctor’s office may schedule it for you. Have an exam and heart scan. In addition to a physical, you may have a special test called a TEE (transesophogeal echocardiogram) which takes pictures of your heart so the doctor can see your LAA and to make sure you don’t have an existing blood clot. Set the date for your WATCHMAN Implant procedure. Your doctor and implant team will tell you how to prepare. Make sure you understand all the instructions, including what medications you should and should not take, and ask any questions you have.

STEP 2 Your doctor guides the WATCHMAN Implant through the tube, into your left atrial appendage (LAA). STEP 3 The procedure is typically done under general anesthesia and takes about 30 minutes. People who get the WATCHMAN Implant generally stay in the hospital for a day or less. STEP 4 After the procedure, your own heart tissue will grow over the WATCHMAN Implant to form a barrier against blood clots. PROCEDURE DAY. AFTER Your doctor will prescribe you a medication regimen they believe is right for you. Typically, this will be one of two options: OPTION A Your doctor will prescribe anti-platelet medicine called clopidogrel (also known as Plavix) and aspirin for 6 months. At your 6-month appointment, your doctor may stop the anti- platelet medicine and you’ll continue to take aspirin on an ongoing basis. OPTION B You may be prescribed a short-term blood thinner (anticoagulant), typically for 45 days. Then your doctor may stop blood thinners and put you on an anti-platelet and aspirin until 6 months post-procedure. After that, you’ll continue to take aspirin on an ongoing basis. These medications are taken until your left atrial appendage is completely closed off. Whichever option they choose, it’s important that you discuss your medications with your doctor and do not change or modify your medications or dosages unless prescribed by your doctor. Most people can return to work within a few days. Gradually add activities to get back to your normal routine. Check with your doctor before resuming exercise or anything strenuous. You may have follow-up appoints after your procedure to have an imaging test to check on the implant and make sure your left atrial appendage (LAA) is sealed. Discuss scheduling your follow-up appointments with your doctor. YOUR FIRST YEAR WITH YOUR WATCHMAN IMPLANT. THE WATCHMAN™ IMPLANT PROCEDURE: WHAT TO EXPECT. 8 9\fWATCHMAN™ IMPLANT.

Bergmann, MD, e Boris Schmidt, MD, f and Jacqueline Saw, MD, FRCPC g Rochester, Minneapolis, MN; New York, NY; Stanford, CA; Hamburg, Frankfurt, Germany; and British Columbia, Canada Background Oral anticoagulants (OACs) reduce stroke risks with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF); however, they are underused because of absolute or relative contraindications due to real or perceived risk of bleeding. Although left atrial appendage closure is increasingly performed in OAC-ineligible patients, this has not been studied in a randomized controlled trial. Study objectives The ASAP-TOO study is designed to establish the safety and effectiveness of the Watchman left atrial appendage closure device in patients with nonvalvular AF who are deemed ineligible for OAC. The primary effectiveness end point is the time to first occurrence of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism. The primary safety end point includes all-cause death, ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, or device- or procedural-related event requiring open cardiac surgery or major endovascular intervention. Study design This is a multinational, multicenter prospective randomized trial. Patients meeting the inclusion criteria with CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 2 and who are deemed by 2 study physicians to be unsuitable for OAC will be randomized in a 2:1 allocation ratio to Watchman versus control. Control patients will be prescribed single antiplatelet therapy or no therapy at the discretion of the study physician. Up to 888 randomized subjects will be enrolled from up to 100 global investigational sites. Both device group and control patients will have follow-up visits at 3, 6, and 12 months and then every 6 months through 60 months. Summary This trial will assess the safety and efficacy of Watchman in this challenging population of high–stroke risk AF patients. (Am Heart J 2017;189:68-74.) Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia both in the United States and worldwide. As populations age with increasing morbid- ity, the incidence increases.1 The relationship between increasing age, AF, and stroke is well documented. AF is associated with a 5-fold increase in stroke rates, and these cardioembolic events are typically associated with marked increases in both mortality and morbidity.2-4 The pathophysiology of stroke in the setting of non- valvular AF has been well studied in pathologic and echocardiographic studies and has been confirmed in the randomized controlled Watchman Left Atrial Appendage System for Embolic Protection in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation (PROTECT-AF) study with left atrial append- age closure (LAAC), which documented equivalent reduction in stroke with Watchman LAAC compared with warfarin. The field continues to evolve based primarily on the introduction and increasing application of non–vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) and the subsequent approval of LAAC with the Watchman device. The former has been documented in multiple random- ized trials to be superior to conventional warfarin therapy for reduction of hemorrhagic stroke, with attenuated reduction in all-cause stroke as well as a reduction in ischemic stroke. Yet NOACs do not or only marginally reduce major bleeding, specifically gastrointestinal, bladder, and skin bleeding events.5-9 In contrast, LAAC has been documented in randomized clinical trials and registries to be associated with a marked reduction in From the a Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, b Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, c Stanford University, Stanford, CA, d Boston Scientific Corp., Minneapolis, MN, e Herzkatheter Asklepios Wandsbek, Hamburg, Germany, f Cardioangiologisches Centrum Bethanien, Frankfurt, Germany, and g Vancouver General Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

Although anticoag- ulants, both warfarin and NOACs, have been the standard of care and proven to reduce stroke in nonvalvular AF, particularly a reduction in hemorrhagic stroke, they are underused particularly in those patients at highest stroke risk.12 This is related to the presence of either absolute or relative contraindications to anticoagulation due to real or perceived risk of bleeding. Accordingly, patients at high risk for stroke are not treated with drugs proven to reduce the risk of stroke. Furthermore, the only randomized control trials of LAAC as an alternative to anticoagulation for stroke prevention mandated that patients be treated with short-term (45 days) warfarin to facilitate rapid endothelialization of the device, potentially limiting this technology in patients at the highest risk for bleeding.10,11 Although there is an increasing amount of information on LAAC in patients treated only with single or dual antiplatelet therapy, it has not been studied in randomized controlled trials. The ASAP-TOO trial has been developed to scientifically address these issues. Study objectives The primary study objective of ASAP-TOO (NCT02928497) is to establish the safety and effectiveness of the Watchman LAAC device (Boston Scientific Corp, Minneapolis, MN) in reducing the risk of thromboembolic ischemic stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular AF who are deemed not eligible for anticoagulant therapy. This is in contradistinction to the current manufacturer's instruction for use that mandates patients receiving the Watchman device be eligible for warfarin therapy and that warfarin therapy be administered for at least 45 days based upon the study protocol of PROTECT-AF and Prospective Random- ized Evaluation of the Watchman LAA Closure Device in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation Versus Long Term Warfarin Therapy (PREVAIL).10,11 The Watchman device has been studied in 2 random- ized clinical trials and multiple national and global registries.10,11,13 As previously described, it is a self-expanding nitinol-framed structure with fixation barbs and a permeable polyester fabric, which covers the ostium of the LAA. The Watchman device (generation 2.5) is available in 5 sizes, with diameters that range from 21 to 33 mm, and chosen depending upon the LAA size. It is implanted by a catheter-based delivery system using a transseptal approach and positioned at or slightly distal to the ostium of the LAA.14 The primary effectiveness end point of this current study is the time to first occurrence of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism. The primary safety end point is the occurrence of one of the following events between the time of implant and within 7 days following the procedure or by hospital discharge, whichever is later: all-cause death, ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, or device- or procedural-related event requiring open cardiac surgery or major endovascular intervention such as pseudoaneurysm repair or arteriovenous fistula repair. Percutaneous catheter drainage of a pericardial effusion, percutaneous retrieval of an embolized device, or thrombin injection to treat femoral pseudoaneurysm and nonsurgical treatments of access site complications are excluded from this safety end point. Secondary end points include the time to first occurrence of the individual components of the primary end point, the composite occurrence of stroke (ischemic and/or hem- orrhagic), systemic embolization and cardiovascular death, the occurrence of major bleeding (defined as bleeding academic research consortium [BARC] ≥3), and characterization of the stroke events (fatal; disabling; or nondisabling). In addition, net clinical benefit (combining all-cause stroke, systemic embolism, cardiovascular death, and major bleeding) and weighted net clinical benefit analyses will be performed. Procedural outcomes including implant success rate, procedural duration, number of devices and sizes used, and residual peridevice leak will be evaluated. Patient selection criteria Patients with documented paroxysmal, persistent, permanent, or long-term/long-standing persistent non- valvular AF are candidates if they (Table I): 1. have a CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 2; 2. are deemed by 2 study physicians to be unsuitable for oral anticoagulation; and 3. are deemed to be suitable for the defined pharma- cologic regimen of aspirin and/or clopidogrel and are willing to follow the required protocol for follow-up visits and examinations. The exclusion criteria include prior stroke/transient ischemic attack within 30 days prior to randomization; BARC type 3 or 4 bleeding within 14 days of randomi- zation; a history of atrial septal aneurysm or patent foramen ovale (PFO) repair; any mechanical heart valve; New York Heart Association class 4 congestive heart failure; life expectancy b2 years; left ventricular ejection fraction b30%; preexisting pericardial effusion N5 mm; and the presence of an intracardiac thrombus, LAA sludge, or dense spontaneous echo contrast within 2 days prior to implant (Tables II and III). The acceptable reasons for patients to be considered unsuitable for oral anticoagulation include the follow- ing (Table IV): 1. History of overt bleeding related or unrelated to oral anticoagulants: prior intracranial hemorrhage or subdural hematoma, major organ bleeding Holmes et al 69 American Heart Journal Volume 189\f(eg, gastrointestinal; genitourinary; ocular; spinal; pulmonary; retroperitoneal; pericardial; or ear, nose, and throat), or epistaxis requiring hospital visit or intervention. 2.

The subject is able and willing to return for required follow-up visits and examinations. ⁎ Ticagrelor or prasugrel may be used in place of clopidogrel if patient has another indication or a known resistance to clopidogrel. Prasugrel should only be used if neither clopidogrel nor tricagrelor can be used because of bleeding risk. 70 Holmes et al American Heart Journal July 2017\fStudy design This is a multinational, multicenter prospective ran- domized clinical trial. Patients meeting the inclusion criteria (Table I) will be randomized stratified by study site to a 2:1 allocation ratio of Watchman versus control. Up to 888 randomized subjects will be enrolled in this study from up to 100 global investigational sites. The protocol and informed consent will have been approved by each investigator's institutional review board before trial initiation. All subjects will have their screening criteria assessed (Figure 1) such that the baseline transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) will be the final study for confirming eligibility. Randomization will be performed electronically to either the device or the control group. Following enrollment and randomization, the device group patients will undergo the implant procedure, and both device group and control patients will have follow-up visits at 3, 6, and 12 months and then every 6 months through 60 months. Both device and control group subjects will be evaluated by a study neurologist blinded to randomization at baseline, 12 months, and 24 months. Control patients will be prescribed single antiplatelet therapy or no therapy for the entire duration of the trial at the discretion of the study physician. Depending on the clinical setting, patients may be on dual antiplatelet therapy if indicated. Patients randomized to the device will undergo implantation within 2 days of the baseline TEE. No other concomitant procedures such as AF ablation will be performed. The implant should be performed using standard-of-care methods established by each investiga- tional site using sterile technique by study physicians trained in percutaneous and transseptal procedures who have completed the manufacturer's physician training program. Information collected will include device release criteria, duration of procedure and fluoroscopy, type of anesthesia, device deficiencies, and device and procedural adverse events. Aspirin should be started 1 day prior to the scheduled implant date and then continued daily for the study duration. Depending on the patient's individual bleeding risk profile, the patient should be heparinized throughout the procedure with a recommended activated clotting time of 200-300 seconds throughout the procedure. Follow-up TEEs will be performed at 3 and 12 months or if a neurologic event has occurred suggesting either transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke. Statistical methods The statistical objective is to determine if LAAC with Watchman is superior to the control group of patients Table IV. Acceptable reasons for unsuitability for oral anticoagulation Reasons for unsuitability for oral anticoagulation 1. History of overt bleeding related or unrelated to oral anticoagulants: • Prior history of intracranial or subdural hemorrhage • Other clinically relevant organ bleeding as defined by requiring hospitalization, transfusion or medical intervention, including the following: gastrointestinal; genitourinary; ocular; spinal; pulmonary; retroperitoneal; pericardial; or ear, nose, and throat. Last event must be within the 6 m prior to randomization. • Epistaxis requiring emergency department visit, hospitalization, or physician intervention. Last event must be within the 6 m prior to randomization. 2. Increased risk of bleeding or bleeding tendencies: • Gastrointestinal lesions resulting in clinically relevant bleeding as defined by requiring hospitalization, transfusion, or medical intervention (eg, esophageal varices, diverticular disease with a history of bleeding in which the site was not identified and presumed to be diverticular). Last event must be within the 6 m prior to randomization. • Active inflammatory bowel disease • Peptic ulcer disease with gastrointestinal bleeding in which it is deemed that anticoagulation cannot be safely initiated or restarted following healing of the peptic ulcer • Uncontrolled seizures • History of traumatic falls with the likelihood of recurrence • Cerebral amyloid angiopathy • Significant thrombocytopenia (defined as platelet count b50 × 109/L) • Need for lifelong dual antiplatelet therapy 3. Contraindications to warfarin and/or direct OAC • Severe renal failure (glomerular filtration rate b30 mL/[min/1.73 m3 ]) • Allergy to the above agents 4. Other contraindications including: • Lifestyle or occupational bleeding risk (ie, anyone who is at risk of trauma as a result of their occupation or their lifestyle. For example, high-voltage electrical line workers, airline pilots, manual laborers, extreme sports enthusiasts) • Poor control on warfarin (time in therapeutic range b 50%) and intolerance to the direct OACs • Other medical or social reasons that make OACs unsuitable (eg, an elderly patient with poor social support and a high risk of bleeding resulting in the use of aspirin alone despite a high stroke risk) Holmes et al 71 American Heart Journal Volume 189\ftreated with single antiplatelet therapy with respect to the primary effectiveness composite end point of ischemic stroke and systemic embolism. The primary method of analysis will be a group sequential design based on the log-rank test to test the null hypothesis of identical time-to-event curves across the device and control groups. The primary analysis for the primary effectiveness end point will be done on an intent-to-treat basis, with each subject analyzed as being part of their randomized group regardless of the actual treatment received. Additional analysis sets, such as the inclusion of only LAAC patients who undergo an implant attempt, will be used for the primary effectiveness end point as sensitivity analyses. The analysis of the primary safety end point will include all data from subjects randomized to the device who undergo an implant attempt. Statistical analyses of the primary efficacy end point between the device and control groups will occur at periodic intervals. The overall type I and type II errors will both be controlled using a power error spending function (ρ = 2). The timing of each analysis will be based on the total number of adjudicated primary effectiveness end point events across both treatment groups; therefore, the exact timing of each analysis cannot be known in advance. The primary safety end point definition as described above and the event rate will be calculated as the percentage of all implanted or attempted subjects randomized to the device arm who experience a primary safety end point event. The observed primary safety end point event rate in the combined PREVAIL and CAP2 device arms was 1.65%. We estimated a slightly higher rate of 3.30% for ASAP-TOO patients randomized to the device given the increased frailty and lack of alternative anticoagulation options for these patients. A delta of 2.50% was added to this expected rate to establish the performance goal of 5.80%. This performance goal corresponds to a maximum observable rate of 4.16% and is deemed to be clinically acceptable based on the observed rates of procedural complications in compara- ble procedures, the magnitude of benefit required to pass the efficacy end point, and the absence of an approved alternative for reduction in the risk of ischemic stroke in this population. A 1-sided exact binomial test will be used to test the assumption that the rate of subjects experiencing a primary safety end point event is ≥5.80%. The null hypothesis will be rejected if the resulting P value is less than .05. Sample size justification For the primary effectiveness end point of ischemic stroke and systemic embolization, power calculation was performed using group sequential design log-rank test. With an expected annual event rate of 2.25% with WATCHMAN and expected treatment effect with hazard ratio 0.5 (WATCHMAN vs control), and with 85% power and 2-sided α b .05, a maximum sample size of 870 patients is required. For the primary safety end point, a sample size of 592 device subjects is required, represent- ing an overall study sample size of 888 subjects. This provides 90% power with 1-sided α of 5% and accom- modating expected attrition rate of 2.5%. Therefore, the overall study sample size (N = 888) will be driven by the Figure 1 ASAP-TOO study flowchart. 72 Holmes et al American Heart Journal July 2017\fprimary safety end point analysis. This sample size provides slightly more than 86.5% power for the primary effectiveness end point analysis. This sample size was calculated using exact binomial methodology using SAS version 9.4. Study organization Clinical Events Committee A Clinical Events Committee (CEC) consisting of an independent group of individuals with pertinent exper- tise including neurology, neuroradiology, interventional cardiology, and electrophysiology will review and adjudicate the events that have been included in the primary and secondary end points. The events that the CEC will review for this study include all strokes, TIA, all-cause death, systemic embolism, bleeding events, and device- and/or procedure-related events which resulted in open cardiac/endovascular surgery. The CEC will review a safety event dossier, which may include copies of subject source documents provided by study sites, and confirm inclusion of the event into the primary and secondary end points. Data Monitoring Committee An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be established to review the data and safety parameters for the study. The DMC will develop a charter and stopping rules for the study. Members will consist of at least 3 physicians in specialties of electrophysiology, interventional cardiology, or neurology. At least 1 member of the committee will be a biostatistician. Periodic meetings will be held by the DMC to review study data and evaluate the impact of identified adverse events. The DMC may recommend revising the study protocol or stopping the study early if an unacceptable rate of adverse events is experienced to maintain the safety and welfare of the involved subjects.

Discussion Cardioembolic stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation is a major clinical problem that can result in markedly increased morbidity and mortality. Given the well-documented relationship between increasing age, increasing incidence of AF, and the associated increased stroke hazard, it has significant public health issues. In this patient population, anticoagulant therapy either with warfarin or increasingly more often with NOACs has been shown to significantly reduce both overall stroke and more specifically hemorrhagic stroke.5 This information has formed the basis for guideline therapy recommenda- tions of these agents in patients at increased risk for stroke. In this group, therapeutic strategies are selected based upon assessment of the risk-benefit ratios using a variety of risk prediction models, most prominently CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED, which are used in combi- nation to select options. There are however several elements identical to both stroke and bleeding risk scores so that patients at increased risk of stroke are also at increased risk of bleeding. Accordingly, some patients do not receive guideline-based medical therapy with an OAC because of concerns of bleeding.12 In addition, up to 25% of patients discontinue such guideline-based therapy within the first 24 months of administration.6-8 Such patients then remain unprotected from the standpoint of stroke prevention. The pathophysiology of stroke in this setting has been well studied; the source of the thrombus responsible for the stroke has been found to be the LAA in approximately 90% of these patients.12 This finding has led to the development of local site-specific therapy with LAA occlusion. Only 1 endovascular device (Watchman) has been approved by the FDA for stroke prevention in this setting, which has been tested in 2 randomized studies and multiple registries, and these data formed the basis for device approval. The PROTECT-AF study showed Watchman to be noninferior to warfarin for overall stroke prevention but superior in respect to a decrease in hemorrhagic stroke and long-term bleeding, and to be associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality. The meta-analysis of PROTECT-AF and PREVAIL also showed similar all-cause stroke or systemic embolization rates between Watchman and warfarin, with lower hemor- rhagic stroke and cardiovascular mortality with Watch- man. For the randomized controlled trials and US registries, a condition of approval was that patients had to be eligible for long-term warfarin.10,11,15,16 According- ly, the instruction for use reflected that, and currently, patients receiving this device must be felt clinically able to take anticoagulants, although there must be a reason for concern on the part of either the physician or patient about long-term use of these agents. The issue has become complicated by the fact that in large non-US registries, the device is implanted in patients who have either a relative or absolute contraindication to oral anticoagulants. In the EWOLUTION Registry of 1,022 patients treated with Watchman, 72% were felt to be in the category of “contraindication” to anticoagulation.13 In a smaller study, ASAP,17 150 patients in whom anticoagulation therapy was contraindicated underwent device implantation. In this population, the rate of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism (1.7% annualized) was 77% less than would be expected for this population if only treated with aspirin (7.3% annualized based on the Holmes et al 73 American Heart Journal Volume 189\fCHADS2 score); this imputed benefit was observed up to 5 years of follow-up.18 In both of these experiences as well as in other registries, the device was safe and efficacious without anticoagulation. The current trial ASAP-TOO is aimed at resolving the issues by randomizing a predicted 888 patients in a 2:1 mode to either Watchman without any oral anticoagula- tion or a comparison group of control patients with similar CHA2DS2-VASc scores who will be treated with either single antiplatelet or no antiplatelet therapy. Summary The ASAP-TOO study is a multicenter randomized controlled trial comparing Watchman LAA closure to single or no antiplatelet therapy in nonvalvular AF patients who are deemed ineligible for OAC. This trial will assess the safety and efficacy of Watchman in this challenging population of high–stroke risk AF patients.
