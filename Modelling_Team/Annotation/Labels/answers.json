It features: Best-in-class deliverability2 Enhanced visibility with thinner struts2 Smooth side branch access2 Fast healing3 The broadest diameter range\fSinusoid-formed wire Helical wrap Laser-fused Competitive comparison Resolute Onyx DES is more deliverable than laser-cut SYNERGY™* XD and XIENCE Skypoint™*, which are stiffer. Deliverability comparison — 3.0 mm DES2 (Lower is better) THE ONLY DES DESIGNED FROM A SINGLE WIRE‡ Proven components for optimal healing Watch a short video to learn more about the BioLinx™ polymer. Single-wire design provides a fluid range of motion and the conformability needed for superior strut apposition.2 BioLinx biocompatible polymer provides superior thromboresistance.4 When combined, fast healing occurs as evidenced by nearly 90% strut coverage at 30 days,3 providing the foundation for the Onyx ONE Global Trial. The Onyx ONE Global Trial analysed real-world, high bleeding risk patients on 1-month DAPT treated with a Resolute Onyx DES or a BioFreedom™* DCS.\fResults showed Resolute Onyx DES was safe and effective,1 providing the option to shorten DAPT in patients who are at high bleeding risk. Based on these results, Resolute Onyx DES was the first DES CE-indicated for HBR patients on 1-month DAPT.

In addition, the Resolute Onyx™ Zotarolimus-Eluting Coronary Stent System is indicated for treating de novo chronic total occlusions. Contraindications The Resolute Onyx™ Zotarolimus-Eluting Coronary Stent System is contraindicated for use in: Patients with a known hypersensitivity or allergies to aspirin, heparin, bivalirudin, clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor, ticlopidine, drugs such as zotarolimus, tacrolimus, sirolimus, everolimus, or similar drugs or any other analogue or derivative Patients with a known hypersensitivity to the cobalt-based alloy (cobalt, nickel, chromium, and molybdenum) or platinum-iridium alloy Patients with a known hypersensitivity to the BioLinx™ polymer or its individual components Coronary artery stenting is contraindicated for use in: Patients in whom antiplatelet and/or anticoagulation therapy is contraindicated Patients who are judged to have a lesion that prevents complete inflation of an angioplasty balloon or proper placement of the stent or stent delivery system Warnings Please ensure that the inner package has not been opened or damaged as this would indicate the sterile barrier has been breached. The use of this product carries the same risks associated with coronary artery stent implantation procedures, which include subacute and late vessel thrombosis, vascular complications, and/or bleeding events. This product should not be used in patients who are not likely to comply with the recommended antiplatelet therapy.\fPrecautions Only physicians who have received adequate training should perform implantation of the stent. Subsequent stent restenosis or occlusion may require repeat catheter-based treatments (including balloon dilatation) of the arterial segment containing the stent. The long-term outcome following repeat catheter-based treatments of previously implanted stents is not well characterized. The risks and benefits of the stent implantation should be assessed for patients with a history of severe reaction to contrast agents. Do not expose or wipe the product with organic solvents such as alcohol. The use of a drug-eluting stent (DES) outside of the labeled indications, including use in patients with more tortuous anatomy, may have an increased risk of adverse events, including stent thrombosis, stent embolization, MI, or death. Care should be taken to control the position of the guide catheter tip during stent delivery, stent deployment, and balloon withdrawal. Before withdrawing the stent delivery system, confirm complete balloon deflation using fluoroscopy to avoid arterial damage caused by guiding catheter movement into the vessel. Stent thrombosis is a low-frequency event that is frequently associated with myocardial infarction (MI) or death. Data from the RESOLUTE clinical trials have been prospectively evaluated and adjudicated using the definition developed by the Academic Research Consortium (ARC). The safety and effectiveness of the Resolute Onyx™ stent have not yet been established in the following patient populations: Patients with target lesions that were treated with prior brachytherapy or the use of brachytherapy to treat in-stent restenosis of a Resolute Onyx™ stent Women who are pregnant or lactating Men intending to father children Pediatric patients below the age of 18 years Patients with coronary artery reference vessel diameters of < 2.0 mm or > 5.0 mm Patients with evidence of an acute ST-elevation MI within 72 hours of intended stent implantation Patients with vessel thrombus at the lesion site Patients with lesions located in a saphenous vein graft, in the left main coronary artery, ostial lesions, or bifurcation lesions Patients with diffuse disease or poor flow distal to identified lesions Patients with three-vessel disease The safety and effectiveness of the Resolute Onyx™ stent have not been established in the cerebral, carotid, or peripheral vasculature. Additionally, the safety and effectiveness of using atherectomy devices with Resolute Onyx™ stent have not been established. The effect of potential drug interactions on the safety or effectiveness of the Resolute Onyx™ stent has not been investigated. Potential interactions of the Resolute Onyx™ stent with other drug-eluting or coated stents have not been evaluated and should be avoided whenever possible. Clinical studies of the Resolute™ stent did not suggest any significant differences in safety and effectiveness for male and female patients and did not include sufficient numbers of patients to assess for differences in safety and effectiveness due to ethnicity. Oral antiplatelet therapy\fDual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) using a combination treatment of aspirin with a P2Y12 platelet inhibitor after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), reduces the risk of stent thrombosis and ischemic cardiac events, but increases the risk of bleeding complications. The optimal duration of DAPT (specifically a P2Y12 platelet inhibitor in addition to aspirin) following DES implantation is unknown, and DES thrombosis may still occur despite continued therapy. It is very important that the patient is compliant with the post-procedural antiplatelet recommendations. Per 2016 ACC/AHA guidelines,1 a daily aspirin dose of 81 mg is recommended indefinitely after PCI. A P2Y12 platelet inhibitor should be given daily for at least 6 months in stable ischemic heart disease patients and for at least 12 months in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Consistent with the DAPT Study,2 and the 2016 ACC/AHA guidelines, longer duration of DAPT may be considered in patients at higher ischemic risk with lower bleeding risk. The Academic Research Consortium (ARC) proposed a standardized definition for identifying patients at high bleeding risk (HBR).3 Additionally, evidence from a dedicated study of Resolute Onyx in HBR patients and those who are unable to tolerate long term DAPT after PCI has been published.4 Based on the Onyx ONE Clear Analysis, Resolute Onyx is safe and effective in patients at high risk of bleeding treated with one month of DAPT. The patients evaluated in the Onyx ONE Clear Analysis met the pre-defined criteria for high bleeding risk and were those whom in the opinion of their physician, the potential benefit of 1-Month DAPT outweighed the potential risk. In addition to at least one HBR risk factor, enrollment included 48.6% ACS patients (unstable angina 22.8%, Non-STEMI 21.7% and STEMI 4.2%). Decisions about duration of DAPT are best made on an individual basis and should integrate clinical judgment, assessment of the benefit/risk ratio, and patient preference. Premature discontinuation or interruption of prescribed antiplatelet medication could result in a higher risk of stent thrombosis, MI, or death. Before PCI, if premature discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy is anticipated, physicians should carefully evaluate with the patient whether a DES and its associated recommended DAPT regimen is the appropriate PCI choice. Following PCI, if elective noncardiac surgery requiring suspension of antiplatelet therapy is considered, the risks and benefits of the procedure should be weighed against the possible risk associated with interruption of antiplatelet therapy. Patients who require premature DAPT discontinuation should be carefully monitored for cardiac events. At the discretion of the patient’s treating physician(s), the antiplatelet therapy should be restarted as soon as possible. Potential adverse effects\fOther risks associated with using this device are those associated with percutaneous coronary diagnostic (including angiography and IVUS) and treatment procedures. These risks (in alphabetical order) may include but are not limited to: Abrupt vessel closure Access site pain, hematoma, or hemorrhage Allergic reaction (to contrast, antiplatelet therapy, stent material, or drug and polymer coating) Aneurysm, pseudoaneurysm, or arteriovenous fistula (AVF) Arrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation Balloon rupture Bleeding Cardiac tamponade Coronary artery occlusion, perforation, rupture, or dissection Coronary artery spasm Death Embolism (air, tissue, device, or thrombus) Emergency surgery: peripheral vascular or coronary bypass Failure to deliver the stent Hemorrhage requiring transfusion Hypotension/hypertension Incomplete stent apposition Infection or fever MI Pericarditis Peripheral ischemia/peripheral nerve injury Renal failure Restenosis of the stented artery Shock/pulmonary edema Stable or unstable angina Stent deformation, collapse, or fracture Stent migration or embolization Stent misplacement Stroke/transient ischemic attack Thrombosis (acute, subacute, or late) Adverse events related to Zotarolimus Patients’ exposure to zotarolimus is directly related to the total amount of stent length implanted. The actual side effects/complications that may be associated with the use of zotarolimus are not fully known. The adverse events that have been associated with the intravenous injection of zotarolimus in humans include but are not limited to: Anemia Diarrhea Dry skin Headache Hematuria Infection Injection site reaction Pain (abdominal, arthralgia, injection site) Rash\fThe potential adverse reactions in nursing infants from zotarolimus have not been determined. The pharmacokinetic and safety profiles of zotarolimus in infants are not known. Adverse events related to BioLinx™ polymer Although the type of risks of the BioLinx™ polymer coating are expected to be no different than those of other stent coatings, the potential for these risks are currently unknown as the coating has limited previous use in humans. These risks may include but are not limited to the following: Allergic reaction Focal inflammation at the site of stent implantation Restenosis of the stented artery Please reference appropriate product Instructions for Use for more information regarding indications, contraindications, warnings, precautions, and potential adverse events.

Email: price.matthew@scrippshealth.org Funding information Medtronic, Santa Rosa, California Abstract Objectives: To assess the safety and efficacy of the novel Resolute (R-) Onyx drug-eluting stent (DES). Background: The R-Onyx DES consists of a composite wire with an outer shell of cobalt chro- mium alloy and a platinum-iridium inner core to enhance radiopacity, with thinner, swaged struts and modified stent geometry compared with the predicate Resolute DES, resulting in a slightly lower total drug load in most sizes. Methods: This was a prospective, single-arm non-inferiority trial compared with a historical con- trol. Patients with stable angina/ischemia and up to 2 de novo target lesions \u001435 mm long with reference vessel diameter (RVD) of 2.25–4.2 mm were enrolled. The primary endpoint was late lumen loss at 8-month follow-up. Propensity-score adjusted outcomes from the single-arm RESO- LUTE-US trial served as the control. Results: Seventy-five patients (85 lesions) were enrolled. Mean patient age was 66 6 9 years, 73% were male, and 32% had diabetes. Mean lesion length was 14.28 6 6.68 mm, mean RVD was 2.57 6 0.48 mm, and 86% of lesions were class B2/C. In-stent late lumen loss at 8 months was 0.24 6 0.39 mm with R-Onyx DES compared with 0.36 6 0.52 mm with Resolute DES (P < 0.001 for noninferiority, P 5 0.029 for superiority). At 8 months, clinically driven target lesion revascularization occurred in 3 patients (4.0%) and target lesion failure occurred in 5 patients (6.7%). Conclusions: In-stent late lumen loss is non-inferior, and appears to be superior, with the thin- strut novel composite wire R-Onyx DES compared with Resolute DES. Continued evolution of stent design can improve angiographic outcomes in complex lesions, even in the current era of next-generation DES. K E Y W O R D S drug eluting stents, late lumen loss, percutaneous coronary intervention, zotarolimus 1 | INTRODUCTION Drug-eluting stents (DES) continue to evolve with the aim to improve procedural success and further reduce the risk of adverse events. This has led to the use of DES in increasingly complex patient and lesion Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02419521 Catheter Cardiovasc Interv. 2017;1–7. wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/ccd V C 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. | 1 Received: 2 June 2017 | Revised: 2 August 2017 | Accepted: 14 August 2017 DOI: 10.1002/ccd.27322 Catheter Cardiovasc Interv. 2018;92:253–259. wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/ccd © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. 253 1522726x, 2018, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ccd.27322 by National University Of Singapo, Wiley Online Library on [21/10/2022].

Although device success is around 97% with current-generation DES, improving device deliverability and conformability are important to ensure continued high procedural success, which also influences long- term patient outcomes. Moreover, enhanced radiopacity is important for accurate placement of stents within a lesion, especially for bifur- cated or heavily calcified lesions and overweight patients. Stent implan- tation also alters local vascular geometry and may cause vascular injury, resulting in changes in wall shear stress dependent on stent design, and can mediate cellular proliferation and neointimal hyperpla- sia [5]. Furthermore, while target lesion revascularization (TLR) with current generation DES is uncommon, clinical success is still limited by the development of in-stent restenosis, particularly in patients with significant anatomic complexity [6]. Thinner stent struts might further reduce neointimal hyperplasia and enhance post-DES outcomes. In addition, reducing stent strut thickness may help address the need for improved deliverability. Importantly, such design iteration could be unfavorable by reduc- ing radiopacity and compromising radial strength. Reduced radiopacity may increase geographic miss, and lack of radial strength can lead to recoil and underexpansion, both of which may result in adverse patient outcomes, including increased late luminal loss, repeat revasculariza- tion, and stent thrombosis. The Resolute (R-) Onyx DES (Medtronic, Santa Rosa, CA), an iteration of the Resolute DES family [7], is com- posed of a composite wire material with a platinum-iridium inner core, and an outer shell of the same cobalt chromium alloy as the predeces- sor Resolute Integrity and Resolute DES, but with a swaged shape and thinner stent struts with sustained radial strength (Figure 1). Zotaroli- mus dose density and polymer are identical between the R-Onyx, Res- olute Integrity, and Resolute DES; however, due to modified stent geometry, the overall drug load is 10–25% lower with R-Onyx DES compared with both Resolute and Resolute Integrity, with the excep- tion of the 2.75 mm size, in which the drug load is on average 10% higher. We hypothesized that the characteristics of the R-Onyx DES would safely provide similar angiographic outcomes as predicate Resolute DES. Therefore, the RESOLUTE ONYX Core trial was a multi- center, prospective study designed to compare the novel R-Onyx DES to historical control data for the Resolute DES. 2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 | Device description The R-Onyx DES uses a single continuous wire with a swaged shape that is formed into a sinusoidal design, wound around a mandrel, and laser-fused at specific crowns to create its final configuration. The outer shell of the R-Onyx DES is the same cobalt chromium alloy as the Resolute DES. The dense inner core of R-Onyx DES is an alloy of 90% platinum and 10% iridium used to enhance radiopacity (Figure 1). The strut thickness of Resolute DES and R-Onyx DES are 91 and 81 lm, respectively, for the 2.25–4.0 mm diameter sizes. R-Onyx has a swaged shape and a larger strut width-to-thickness ratio than Resolute DES to maintain radial strength despite thinner struts. Specifically, the width of R-Onyx remains 91 lm but the thickness was reduced to 81 lm. Zotarolimus dose density and polymer are identical to the Resolute DES; however, due to modified stent geometry, the overall drug load is slightly reduced in most sizes of the R-Onyx DES. 2.2 | Clinical study design The RESOLUTE ONYX Core (2.25–4.0 mm) Clinical Study was a single- arm, open-label, multicenter, noninferiority study involving 12 centers in the United States using propensity-adjusted results of the angio- graphic cohort of the RESOLUTE-US clinical trial as a historical control (Supporting Information Table S1) [8]. Eligible patients had evidence of ischemic heart disease, stable or unstable angina, and/or a positive FIGURE 1 Cross-sectional view of (A) strut of Resolute DES (91 mm thickness) and (B) swaged strut of R-Onyx DES (81 mm thick- ness), not shown to scale. Both stents are manufactured using a continuous sinusoid wire. The Resolute DES consists of a solid cobalt alloy (shown in gray). The R-Onyx DES is manufactured from a composite wire, which has an outer shell and an inner core. The outer shell, which is in contact with the vessel, is of the identi- cal cobalt chromium alloy used for the Resolute DES. The inner core wire material is a platinum-iridium alloy (shown in white) intended to enhance radiopacity.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\ffunctional study demonstrating a need for treatment of up to 2 target lesions in separate vessels. Key exclusion criteria included evidence of an acute myocardial infarction (MI) within 72 hr before the intended procedure, planned percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of any vessel within 30 days after the index procedure, and planned PCI of the target vessel(s) within 12 months after the procedure. After the procedure, patients received aspirin 75–325 mg daily indefinitely and a thienopyridine daily for at least 6 months and up to 12 months in patients who were not at high risk of bleeding [9]. All enrolled patients were required to undergo angiography at 8 months at the center where the index procedure was performed. Clinical follow-up was per- formed at 30 days, 6 months, and 8 months postintervention. The institutional review board at each center approved the study protocol, and all patients provided written informed consent. A Data Monitoring Committee continuously monitored the ongoing safety and scientific validity of the study, and an independent Clinical Events Committee adjudicated clinical endpoints. 2.3 | Quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) QCA was performed after bolus infusion of intracoronary nitrates dur- ing the index procedure and at 8-month follow-up. A cohort of patients was enrolled in an IVUS sub-study, in which IVUS was performed at the end of the index procedure and at the time of the 8-month angio- gram. An independent core laboratory performed the QCA and IVUS analyses (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center - Cardiovascular Imag- ing Core Laboratory, Boston, MA and Cardiovascular Research Founda- tion, NY, respectively). 2.4 | Study endpoints The primary endpoint was in-stent late lumen loss at 8 months post- procedure. Secondary angiographic endpoints included binary angio- graphic restenosis, defined as \u001550% diameter stenosis (DS). Secondary clinical endpoints included acute device, lesion, and procedure success; cardiac death; target vessel MI; cardiac death and target vessel MI combined; TLR; target lesion failure (TLF); stent thrombosis; and major adverse cardiac events (MACE; defined as death, Q-wave and non-Q- wave MI, emergency coronary bypass surgery, or clinically driven repeat TLR). Additional endpoints in the IVUS subgroup included the rate of incomplete stent apposition (categorized as persistent or late), neointimal hyperplastic volume, and percent volume obstruction. 2.5 | Statistical analyses The primary endpoint of in-stent late lumen loss at 8 months post- procedure was compared to the angiographic cohort of the single-arm RESOLUTE US Clinical Trial using a non-inferiority margin of 0.20 mm adjusting for propensity score quintile. A total sample size of 75 patients (60 evaluable patients assuming an 80% angiographic follow-up rate) was calculated to yield >80% power to detect noninferiority using a 2- sample t test with a 1-sided significance level of 0.05, assuming a true equivalence of the means between the 2 groups and a relatively smaller standard deviation of 0.45 mm for R-Onyx DES. The propensity score method was used to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics between the cohorts since patients in the two cohorts were not directly randomized. Propensity scores were calculated using the following cova- riates: lesion length, baseline reference vessel diameter (RVD), age, sex, diabetes, history of MI, and Canadian Cardiovascular Society angina class. If non-inferiority of in-stent late lumen loss was demonstrated and a numerically smaller in-stent late lumen loss with R-Onyx DES was observed, then a superiority analysis was performed using propensity score adjustment. An independent statistician who was blinded to the study outcomes performed the propensity score analysis and submitted propensity score calculations to the Food and Drug Administration for review and approval prior to any data analysis. Categorical variables are expressed as counts and percentages and continuous variables are presented as mean 6 standard deviation. All analyses were performed using SAS for Windows, version 9.1 or higher (SAS, Cary, NC). 3 | RESULTS 3.1 | Patient characteristics A total of 75 patients with 85 lesions were enrolled and underwent stent placement in 1 or more lesions. Patient flow is illustrated in Figure 2, and baseline demographics and clinical characteristics are shown in Table 1 and Supporting Information Table S2. The average patient age was 66.16 9.4 years, 73.3% of patients were male, and 32.0% had diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, 40% of patients had undergone prior PCI. Proce- dural and lesion characteristics are presented in Table 2. The mean lesion length was 14.286 6.68 mm, the mean RVD was 2.576 0.48 mm, and 85.9% of the lesions were American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association class B2 or C. Vascular access was performed by the radial approach in the majority of cases (61.3%). Per-protocol, pre-dilata- tion was performed on all lesions; post-dilatation was performed in 51.1% of cases. Device and lesion success rates were both 100%. 3.2 | Angiographic outcomes The primary endpoint, in-stent late lumen loss at 8 months, was 0.246 0.39 mm for R-Onyx DES compared with 0.366 0.52 mm for the historical Resolute DES control (upper limit of the propensity score adjusted one-sided 95% confidence interval of the mean difference5 20.02 mm, P< 0.001 for noninferiority and P 5 0.029 for superiority; Figure 3). Late luminal loss stratified by propensity score quintile is shown in Supporting Information Table S3. Angiographic in-stent binary restenosis occurred in 4 patients (5.5%) and in-segment binary restenosis occurred in 6 patients (8.2%). Other angiographic endpoints are shown in Table 3. In-stent late lumen loss was 0.296 0.48 among diabetics compared with 0.216 0.34 among nondiabetics (P5 0.48). 3.3 | IVUS cohort At 8 months, incomplete stent apposition was present in 2 of the 20 evaluable lesions in the IVUS cohort (10%).

There were no cases of late acquired incomplete stent apposition. Neointimal hyperplastic volume was 9.886 9.38 mm3 and percent volume obstruction was 6.886 8.00% (Table 3). 3.4 | Clinical outcomes Clinical outcomes are presented in Table 4. At 8-month follow-up, the rate of TLF was 6.7% (5 patients; Figure 4). Clinically driven TLR occurred in 3 patients (4%), target vessel MI in 2 patients (2.7%; both attributed to peri-procedural MIs that occurred at the index procedure), and there were no cardiac deaths. There was one episode of stent thrombosis, which occurred on the day of index procedure. FIGURE 2 Patient disposition.

This low late loss was reflected clinically in low rates of TLF and clinically driven TLR. These findings support the hypothesis that specific characteristics of the R-Onyx DES stent, including thinner struts, greater radiopacity, modified strut shape, and identical drug density but generally lower overall drug load compared with the predicate Resolute DES, may have contributed to superior angiographic outcomes with 100% device and lesion success rates in this cohort of patients with complex lesion anat- omy according to ACC/AHA lesion scores. Several factors may have resulted in the superior in-stent late lumen loss with the R-Onyx DES. Randomized trials of bare metal stents have demonstrated that for stents with similar design, the risk for restenosis is dependent on strut thickness [10]. The R-Onyx DES has identical drug dose density and polymer coating composition as the Resolute DES and Resolute Integrity, but with slightly less total drug load in most sizes. The results of the current study support the hypothesis that continued reduction in strut thickness can improve late lumen loss when radial strength is preserved, even when compared with current generation DES. Furthermore, the results confirm that any differences in total drug load with R-Onyx DES did not negatively affect angiographic outcomes. Strut shape may also affect endotheliali- zation, neointimal hyperplasia, and possibly stent thrombosis by influ- encing endothelial shear stress (6). The R-Onyx stent has a “swaged” shape compared with Resolute DES (Figure 1). Further study is required to determine whether the swaged shape of the R-Onyx strut favorably influences outcomes beyond acute deliverability. The rates of TLF and clinically driven TLR at 8-month follow-up for R-Onyx DES were 6.7% (5 events) and 4% (3 events), respectively.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\fThese rates compare favorably with those observed at 9-month fol- low-up in the angiographic sub-study of the RESOLUTE-US clinical trial (11.2% and 8.2% for TLF and clinically driven TLR, respectively). This is despite the greater anatomic complexity enrolled in the current study, in which 86% of the target lesions were classified as ACC/AHA type B2/C, compared with 75% of the target lesions in the RESOLUTE-US clinical trial. While such comparisons are underpowered and unad- justed, the relative rates of the clinical outcomes are qualitatively con- sistent with the angiographic outcomes demonstrated in the current study. The enhanced radiopacity of the R-Onyx stent might have also contributed to the low clinical event rates that were observed, since geographic miss has been associated with increased MACEs, including target vessel revascularization [11], although this is speculative. More- over, TLF rates for R-Onyx were also similar to that of other DES with similar radiopacity [12]. Given the acute performance characteristics and the observed late loss of the R-Onyx DES, the findings of the cur- rent study indirectly support the incremental clinical utility of the R- Onyx over the predicate Resolute DES, particularly in the setting of complex lesion anatomy. Further, larger studies are required to confirm that the angiographic outcomes associated with R-Onyx DES translate into improved longer-term, stent-oriented clinical outcomes, and to compare the clinical outcomes with the various newest generations of thin-strutted, visible DES. 4.1 | Limitations The RESOLUTE ONYX Core trial was not randomized. However, base- line differences between R-Onyx DES and the historical control were adjusted using the propensity score method, incorporating the known predictors of late lumen loss. Resolute DES was chosen as the historical control for this trial instead of R-Integrity DES, as late lumen loss meas- urements were available for Resolute DES through the Resolute-US trial. R-Integrity DES and Resolute DES have the same drug density and there are no significant differences in stent geometry or drug dis- tribution. Superiority testing was a secondary analysis only if noninfer- iority was achieved. The study had a small sample size and was not powered for individual clinical outcomes. 5 | CONCLUSIONS In-stent late lumen loss is non-inferior, and appears to be superior, with the thin-strut novel composite wire Resolute Onyx DES compared with Resolute DES. Continued evolution of stent design can improve angio- graphic outcomes, even in the current era of next-generation DES.

Introduction In recent years, a series of advances in stent technology has led to steady improvements in rates of restenosis and stent thrombosis and has reduced the need for repeat revascularization. The development of ultrathin struts, improvements in polymer biocompatibility, and the de- velopment of bioresorbable polymers have all aimed to decrease early stent thrombosis and reduce local inﬂammatory and hypersensitivity reactions, leading to reduced rates of in-stent restenosis, need for revas- cularization, and lower incidence of other adverse clinical events [1]. Biodegradable-polymer stents were designed to allow the steady and controlled eluting of antiproliferative drugs in the early phases of treat- ment. This mitigates neointimal hyperplasia [2] while at the same time, through the polymer's degradation, removing the nidus of inﬂamma- tion at the vessel interface that is thought to be responsible for the “catch up” phenomenon of very late stent thrombosis observed with early generation drug-eluting stents (DES) [3]. The Orsiro BP-SES is available in diameters of 2.25, 2.5, 2.75, 3.0, 3.5, and 4.0 mm, and is available in lengths ranging from 9 to 40 mm. Stents with diameters of 2.25 to 3.0 mm have a strut thickness of 60 μm, while stents with diameters of 3.5 to 4.0 mm have a strut thickness of 80 μm [4]. Drawing together recent technological advances, the Orsiro coro- nary stent (Biotronik, Buelach, Switzerland) consists of two distinct layers packaged around its metallic struts [2]. The innermost layer of the system consists of a cobalt‑chromium alloy PRO-Kinetic energy™ stent arranged in a double helix pattern, which is designed to improve ﬂexibility and deliverability. The middle proBIO™ layer consists of a silicon carbide coating that seals the metal alloy surface and reduces the allergenic interaction of metal ions with the vessel wall and blood pool [5]. Finally, the outer BIOlute™ layer is composed of a bioabsorbable poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) polymer contain- ing the antiproliferative sirolimus agent. The active BIOlute™ coating is distributed in an asymmetric fashion on the struts, with a thickness of 7.5 μm on the abluminal side and a thinner 3.5-μm layer on the luminal portion of the stent. Fig. 1 demonstrates the stent strut design. The PLLA polymer undergoes a hydrolytic reaction upon contact with the blood pool, causing the polymer to break down into CO2 and H2O via the Krebs cycle. The sirolimus load is 1.4 μg/mm2 [6] with the elution opti- mized for 12 to 14 weeks after implantation. Fig. 2 summarizes some of the key design features in comparison with other contemporary stent designs. In vitro studies have shown that within 30 days, 50% of the drug is eluted, and within 3 months, 80% is eluted. The PLLA degrades over 2 years, leaving the thin-strut cobalt‑chromium stent with minimal en- dothelial injury [5]. This hybrid approach of combining ultrathin struts, a passive intermediate layer, and bioabsorbable polymer is aimed at creating less ﬂow disturbance, limiting the long-term inﬂammatory Cardiovascular Revascularization Medicine 21 (2020) 540–548 Abbreviations: BP-SES, biodegradable-polymer sirolimus-eluting stent; CTO, chronic total occlusion; CI, conﬁdence interval; DCB, drug-coated balloon; DES, drug-eluting stent; DP-DES, durable-polymer drug-eluting stent; LLL, late lumen loss; PLLA, poly-L-lac- tic acid polymer; PP-EES, permanent-polymer everolimus-eluting stent; STEMI, ST- elevation myocardial infarction; TLF, target lesion failure; TLR, target lesion revasculariza- tion; TVF, target vessel failure; TVR, target vessel revascularization. ⁎ Corresponding author at: MedStar Washington Hospital Center, 110 Irving St., NW, Suite 4B-1, Washington, DC 20010, United States of America.

In larger stent diameters, where the comparative advantage of strut thickness is less (80 μm in stents with diameters N3.5 mm), the additional design features of the inert silicon carbide layer and biodegradable polymer may still confer beneﬁts in vascular healing and long-term inﬂammation in comparison with other contemporary stents of similar strut thickness. 2. Discussion Several investigator- and industry-initiated randomized controlled trials have examined the efﬁcacy and safety of the Orsiro BP-SES in re- cent years. Cumulatively, these trials have enrolled close to 30,000 pa- tients around the world and have examined de novo lesions, acute coronary syndromes, and high-risk subgroups such as small-vessel dis- ease, diabetes, and chronic total occlusions. Table 1 describes the key randomized trials and registries, which are discussed below, followed by an additional focused discussion on the Orsiro BP-SES performance in high-risk subgroups. 2.1. The BIOFLOW trials The introduction of drug-eluting stents (DES) brought about major advances in combating early restenosis but also raised concerns about delayed intimal healing and prolonged inﬂammation [7] at the site of implant, leading to late events such as stent thrombosis and in-stent re- stenosis [8]. The development of biodegradable-polymer stents was intended to reduce the local inﬂammatory response and allow im- proved endothelization, decreasing the risk of late events such as stent thrombosis and in-stent restenosis [9]. Starting in 2013, the BIOFLOW trials were conducted to examine the safety, efﬁcacy, and noninferiority of the Orsiro BP-SES against several leading second-generation DES. Re- sults of these studies were used to support regulatory approval for the use of the Orsiro stent system in Europe, Japan, China, and the United States. BIOFLOW I [6] was a ﬁrst-in-man study designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the newly developed Orsiro BP-SES hybrid stent system. The trial included 30 patients with de novo lesions and demonstrated a low rate of in-stent restenosis with late lumen loss (LLL) of 0.05 ± 0.22 mm over the 9-month follow-up period. Though small, the BIOFLOW I study demonstrated that there was merit in the technology and, more importantly, that it was safe, with no myocardial infarction (MI) or stent thrombosis reported. The follow-on BIOFLOW II [3] study was a prospective, international, randomized controlled, noninferiority trial that compared Orsiro BP- SES in a 2:1 allocation ratio with the benchmark stent of the day, Xience Prime (Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, California). The trial also included a subgroup analysis, which allocated patients to repeat optical coherence tomography (OCT) for disease occurring in small vessels (b2.75 mm di- ameter) and diabetic patients (n = 55). The initial 9-month follow-up data published in 2015 showed non-inferior LLL compared with Xience (Orsiro 0.10 ± 0.32 mm vs. Xience 0.11 ± 0.29 mm, pnoninferiority b 0.0001). Similar to BIOFLOW I, no events of deﬁnite or probable stent thrombosis were reported in the Orsiro BP-SES group (298 patients, 332 lesions) [3]. The 5-year clinical follow-up data released in 2018 showed noninferior target lesion failure (TLF) (Orsiro 10.4% vs. Xience 12.7%, p = 0.473) with signiﬁcantly lower mortality in vessels b2.75 mm (Orsiro 3.7% vs. 11.3%, P = 0.022), [10] suggesting that the 60-μm thin Orsiro BP-SES proﬁle may provide additional beneﬁt in small-vessel subgroups. The recent publication of BIOFLOW VI [11] in China conﬁrms the noninferior rates of LLL (Orsiro 0.05 mm ± 0.21 mm vs. Xience Prime 0.07 mm ± 0.2 mm) and TLF (Orsiro 2.3% vs. Xience 1.8%, p = 0.7505) when compared with Xience. The BIOFLOW III [12,13] trial built on the ﬁndings of BIOFLOW II and aimed to gather “real world” data on TLF at 12 months using a prospec- tive, open-label, registry-based design. Enrolling close to 1400 patients, the registry reported a TLF rate of 5.1% over 12 months (95% CI 4.0% to 6.4%), with a rate of 10% (95% CI 8.4% to 12.0%) in the 5-year follow- up study [12]. Low rates of stent thrombosis similar to previous trials were observed (0.2% at 12 months, 95% CI 0.1% to 0.7%). BIOFLOW IV [14] was designed as a noninferiority trial to allow reg- ulatory approval in Japan. A total of 579 patients with de novo lesions were randomized in a 2:1 fashion to receive Orsiro BP-SES vs. the Xience permanent-polymer everolimus-eluting stent (PP-EES). Patients for planned intervention and patients presenting with MI in the previous 72 h were excluded. A total number of 385 patients (441 lesions) were enrolled. Twelve-month follow-up data reported a noninferior rate of target vessel failure (TVF) in de novo lesions compared with Xience (Orsiro 5.5% vs. Xience7.5%, pnoninferiority b 0.0001). These data echoed the previous European BIOFLOW I, II, and III ﬁndings with simi- lar rates of TLF and stent thrombosis, demonstrating applicability of those ﬁndings to the Japanese population and facilitating Japanese reg- ulatory approval in January 2018 [15]. Five-year follow-up is ongoing, with results expected in 2024. With regulatory approval in hand in both Europe and Japan, the BIOFLOW V [2] trial randomized patients to receive Orsiro BP-SES or Xience in patients presenting for elective or urgent percutaneous coro- nary intervention (PCI) at 90 hospitals across 13 countries, including the United States for the ﬁrst time. The primary endpoint of the trial was TLF at 12 months. Of patients included in the study, 51% presented with an acute coronary syndrome. Although BIOFLOW V was powered as a non- inferiority trial, over the initial 12-month period, the incidence of TLF was signiﬁcantly lower in the Orsiro BP-SES group than in the Xience DP-EES group (Orsiro 6.2% vs. Xience 9.6%, p = 0.0399) and was likely driven by a lower rate of target vessel MI in the Orsiro BP-SES group (Orsiro 5% vs. Xience 8%, p = 0.0155) [16]. In order to improve endpoint detection and statistical signiﬁcance, the authors of BIOFLOW V incorporated the results of BIOFLOW II and IV and used a Bayesian analysis [17]. This pooled analysis showed a TLF rate of 3% in the Orsiro BP-SES group with a posterior probability for noninferiority of 100% and a posterior probability of superiority of 97% [2]. A subsequent landmark analysis of the BIOFLOW V data con- ﬁrmed that the statistically signiﬁcant differences in TLF and target ves- sel MI reported at one year persisted through two-year follow-up [18]. Shortly after BIOFLOW V's publication, the Food and Drug Administra- tion granted approval for use of the device in the United States [19]. 2.2. The BIOSCIENCE, BIO-RESORT, BIONYX, and SORT OUT VII and IX trials In addition to the data provided by the BIOFLOW studies, several large-scale investigator-initiated trials demonstrating the safety and efﬁ- cacy of the Orsiro BP-SES have also emerged. Fig. 3 shows rates of TLF at 12 months from selected prospective randomized controlled trials com- paring the Orsiro BP-SES with the Xience PP-EES. The BIOSCIENCE [1] trial, published in 2014, was similar to BIOFLOW II in design and was a large scale, 1:1 randomized noninfe- riority trial. Unlike BIOFLOW II, however, patients with acute coro- nary syndrome in the preceding 72 h were included. Patient enrollment was completed in 12 months, with 2119 patients and 3139 lesions enrolled. The primary endpoint of TLF at 12 months showed that Orsiro BP-SES was non-inferior to Xience DP-EES (Orsiro 6.5% vs. Xience 6.6%, pnoninferiority b 0.0004), similar to the ﬁndings of BIOFLOW II. A novel ﬁnding, however, was the subgroup analysis in patients treated with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). In the prespeciﬁed subgroup of acute coronary syndromes with STEMI, the Orsiro BP-SES was associated with a lower risk of TLF than the Xience PP-EES at 12 months (Orsiro 3.3% vs. Xience 8.7%, p = 0.024) [1,20]. The BIOSCIENCE 5-year follow-up data [20] failed to show any difference in the TLF rate at 5 years between the two groups, suggesting that the reduction seen at 12 months may be related to the BP-SES's ultrathin struts, and that after complete 541 B.J. Forrestal et al. / Cardiovascular Revascularization Medicine 21 (2020) 540–548\fbreakdown of the biodegradable polymer, the risk of very late TLF is similar to that observed with permanent-polymer stents. One question that remained after the publication of the early BIOFLOW trials and the BIOSCIENCE trial was whether the low rates of TLF observed with the Orsiro BP-SES were due to the thin strut design and the absence of a permanent-polymer stent within the vessel wall, re- ducing vascular inﬂammation and the development of neoatherosclerosis. The BIO-RESORT [21] study aimed to answer this question using a large-scale, multicenter three-arm randomized control trial. The 3514 patients who were enrolled included all-comers and acute coronary syndromes with minimal exclusion factors and random- ized patients to receive one of three stents.

Forrestal et al. / Cardiovascular Revascularization Medicine 21 (2020) 540–548\fIntegrity durable-polymer zotarolimus-eluting stent (91 μm, DP-ZES). Over 12 months, the Orsiro BP-SES proved to be noninferior to the durable-polymer Resolute Integrity stents and had similar rates of TVF as the Synergy BP-EES [21,22]. Follow-up data at 2 years showed that TVF was not statistically dif- ferent between the three stents; however, when TLF was examined using a landmark analysis between 12 and 24 months, Orsiro BP-SES fared better than Resolute, with a target vessel revascularization (TVR) rate of 0.6% for Orsiro compared with 1.5% for Resolute, suggesting that Orsiro BP-SES reduced the risk of revascularization after 1 year of follow-up [22]. Based on the rates of TLF seen in the BIOFLOW V [2] and BIO-RESORT [21,22] studies, the Orsiro BP-SES was selected as the comparator for the ﬁrst randomized controlled trial of the newly designed Resolute Onyx stent (Medtronic, Santa Rosa, California, USA) in the BIONYX trial [23]. Resolute Onyx was developed as a thin-strut durable-polymer zotarolimus-eluting stent system. The trial included all comers, ran- domizing 2516 patients in a 1:1 fashion. Both stents showed excellent safety and efﬁcacy, with low rates of deﬁnite or probable stent thrombo- sis in both groups (Orsiro 0.7% vs. Onyx 0.1%, hazard ratio 0.11 [95% CI 0.01–0.87]; p = 0.0112). The primary endpoint of TLF at 12 months was similar in both the Orsiro BP-SES and Onyx groups [23]. Funding has been secured for up to three years of follow-up, with two-year data expected in the coming months. Whereas the BIOFLOW, BIO-RESORT, BIOSCIENCE, and BIONYX trials compared Orsiro BP-SES to durable-polymer systems, the SORT OUT VII trial [24] was the ﬁrst head-to-head trial against a biodegradable- polymer system. The registry-based, multicenter, noninferiority trial randomized patients to receive the Orsiro BP-SES or the Nobori (stain- less-steel, biolimus-eluting, 120-μm strut) stent. The trial enrolled 2525 patients, with TLF at 12 months being the primary endpoint. Orsiro BP-SES was shown to be noninferior to Nobori at 12 months with re- spect to TLF (Orsiro 3.8% vs. Nobori 4.6%, 95% CI 0.12–0.92; pnoninferiority = 0.034). The rates of reported TLF were most likely lower than re- ported in the large BIOSCIENCE trial (6.5%), as the SORT OUT (3.8%) trial excluded procedure-related MI because of the registry-based de- sign. In addition, the Orsiro BP-SES demonstrated a statistically lower rate of deﬁnite of probable stent thrombosis at 12 months (Orsiro 0.4% vs. Nobori 1.2%, p = 0.03) [24]. Further studies against polymer-free drug-coated stents, such as the SORT OUT IX [25] trial, showed that the biolimus-based BioFreedom stent failed to meet the criteria for noninferiority of TLF at 12 months compared with Orsiro BP-SES, likely driven by a lower rate of target lesion revascularization (TLR) in the Orsiro BP-SES arm of the study [26]. Recent meta-analyses have suggested that the improved rates of TLF may be re- lated to an increased risk of stent thrombosis in thick-strut platforms such as 120-μm Nobori and 120-μm BioFreedom stents compared with the 60- μm Orsiro BP-SES system [27–29]. Data provided by the Swedish Coronary Angiography and Angioplasty Registry (SCAAR) corroborate the results seen in randomized trials. An analysis over the 6-year period from October 2011 to June 2017 including 74,131 patients (4561 in the Orsiro group compared to 69,570 who re- ceived other frequently used DES) showed signiﬁcantly lower rates of TLR in the Orsiro group (Orsiro 1.6% vs. other DES 2.3%, adjusted HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.60–0.94; p = 0.012) [30]. 2.3. Evidence in high-risk subgroups PCI in high-risk subgroups can present several challenging patient and lesion characteristics and can result in increased rates of in-stent re- stenosis, TVF, and stent thrombosis. The following section will address the performance of the Orsiro BP-SES in these high-risk subgroups. 2.3.1. ST-elevation myocardial infarction Patients presenting with STEMI pose several challenges to PCI. Malapposition of stent struts may result from undersizing and subse- quent thrombus resolution, setting the stage for an increased risk of early stent thrombosis [31]. Although the development of DES allowed for substantial improvements in early stent thrombosis, concerns remained about delayed vascular healing due to hypersensitivity and inﬂammation induced by permanent-polymer stents [32,33]. The thin- strut proﬁle coupled with the inert silicon carbide coating of the Orsiro BP-SES has shown promise in reducing rates of TLF, based on subgroup analyses in larger recent trials [2,20,31,34]. The BIOSCIENCE trial's 12- and 24-month [1,22] results demon- strated improved outcomes in STEMI patients. Twelve-month rates of TLF were reported at 3.3% vs. 8.7% in the BP-SES and DP-EES groups (risk ratio [RR] 0.38, p = 0.024) with 24-month data showing rates of 5.4% vs 10.8% (RR 0.48, p = 0.043) [32]. Most notably, the lower observed rates of TLF appeared to be driven by decreased rates of cardiac death or MI in the BP-SES group (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.21–1.02, p = 0.05) [32]. BIOFLOW V data showed a similar reduc- tion in TLF with a reported hazard ratio of 0.50 (95% CI 0.28–0.89) compared to DP-EES [2]. The combined results of the BIOFLOW V and BIOSCIENCE noninferi- ority trials and the demonstrated improved outcomes led to the design of the BIOSTEMI trial [35]. The trial enrolled 1300 patients presenting with STEMI with 1:1 randomization to the BP-SES or DP-EES treatment group. Unlike previous trials powered for noninferiority, BIOSTEMI demonstrated, for the ﬁrst time, clear superiority with respect to rates of TLF at 12 months in patients presenting with STEMI (Orsiro 4% vs. Xience 6%, rate ratio 0.59, posterior probability of superiority 0.986) [36]. The difference in the rates of TLF was driven primarily by fewer cases of clinically indicated TLR in the Orsiro group.

Forrestal et al. / Cardiovascular Revascularization Medicine 21 (2020) 540–548\f2.3.2. Chronic total occlusions Chronic total occlusions (CTOs) present one of the toughest envi- ronments for stent performance with respect to in-stent thrombosis and late or very late in-stent restenosis [37,38]. When compared to de novo lesions, CTOs are typically longer and more calciﬁed, often require multiple stents with overlapping segments, and may un- dergo late vessel remodeling as blood ﬂow increases, leading to va- sodilation and stent-strut malapposition, setting the stage for thrombosis or in-stent restenosis [39,40]. The PRISON IV [40] trial set out to evaluate the Orsiro BP-SES performance in this challenging population. Enrolling 330 patients, the trial randomized patients to receive Orsiro BP-SES or Xience in a 1:1 allocation. Of patients en- rolled in both arms of the trial, 99% underwent repeat angiography at 9 months and clinical follow-up at 12 months. PRISON IV failed to meet the primary endpoint of noninferior LLL at 9 months of Orsiro BP-SES compared with Xience and showed a signiﬁcantly higher rate of binary restenosis in the Orsiro BP-SES group (Orsiro 8.0% vs. Xience 2.1%, p = 0.028). The recent publication of the 3-year follow up data of the PRISION IV trial [41] gives the best long-term follow up of the Orsiro BP-SES's per- formance in CTOs. Over the three years of follow-up, the cumulative in- cidence of major adverse clinical events was higher in the Orsiro BP-SES arm than in the Xience EES arm (9.7% vs. 4.2%). Similar trends were also seen with respect to TLR over the study period favoring Xience with TLR rates reported as 9.7% in the Orsiro arm versus 3.4% in the Xience arm. A landmark analysis demonstrated that after one year, rates of TLR overall remained low but were higher in the Orsiro arm than in the Xience arm (2.1% vs. 0.6%, p-value reported as “NS”) [41]. In a smaller, non-randomized study, Markovic et al. [38] examined LLL at 9 months in patients receiving the Resolute Integrity zotarolimus- eluting stent versus the Orsiro BP-SES. Rates of LLL were signiﬁcantly less in the Orsiro BP-SES arm (Orsiro 0.24 ± 0.53 mm vs. Resolute Integ- rity 0.59 ± 0.72 mm, p = 0.01), but this did not translate into a difference in clinical events up to 24 months of follow-up. Although PRISON IV failed to show noninferiority with respect to LLL, the study was underpowered to detect clinical endpoints. The rates of TVR were higher in PRISON IV compared with BIOSCIENCE (9.2% vs. 4%), but this was probably due to the routine angiographic follow-up at 9 months in the PRISON IV trial as opposed to reported clin- ical events in the BIOSCIENCE trial. Subgroup analyses have demon- strated that the majority of the LLL seen within the PRISON IV study is due to stents with b3 mm in diameter (60-μm strut thickness) vs. stents N3 mm in diameter (80-μm strut thickness) [42]. An additional OCT sub- group analysis demonstrated favorable strut coverage in the Orsiro arm [43]. Despite these ﬁndings, results from CTO patients in BIOFLOW III [12,13] and SORT OUT VII [44] suggest that rates of TLF and TLR remain low in CTO subgroups. 2.3.3. Diabetes A recent meta-analysis pooling diabetic patients from the BIOFLOW II, IV, and V trials examined TLF at 1 year. The analysis included 494 di- abetic patients treated with Orsiro BP-SES and 263 patients treated with Xience across the three BIOFLOW trials. Rates of TLF were similar at one year: 6.3% in the Orsiro BP-SES group and 8.7% in the Xience group (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.047–1.43, p = 0.493) [16]. These ﬁndings were conﬁrmed in a subgroup analysis of the SORT OUT VII trial [45]. Rates of TLF among patients treated with or without insulin were also found to be similar [45]. 2.3.4. Small-vessel disease Small-vessel disease, generally deﬁned as vessels b2.75 mm in diameter, has been associated with a greater risk of TLR due to in- creased rates of in-stent restenosis [46,47]. Data from BIOFLOW II [10] and a subgroup analysis from BIO-RESORT [48] suggest that the ultrathin Orsiro BP-SES may provide additional beneﬁt in small-vessel subgroups. BIOFLOW II contained 259 patients within the small-vessel sub- group (≤2.75 mm) and demonstrated 5-year TLF rates of 11.1% in the BP-SES arm vs. 15.5% in the DP-EES arm (p = 0.303), a difference that was mainly due to a lower rate of death in the BP-SES arm (3.7% vs. 11.3%, p = 0.039) [10]. A subsequent analysis of the BIO-RESORT trial examined the 3-year outcomes in 1506 of the 3514 total trial participants. A multivariate analysis later showed that BP-SES was independently associated with lower rates of TLR at 3 years in com- parison with the everolimus and zotarolimus treatment groups (ad- justed HR 0.42, 95% CI 0.20–0.85, p = 0.02). No differences were reported in the rates of cardiac death, target vessel MI, or stent thrombosis at 3 years [48]. Results from the small-vessel cohort of the BIOSCIENCE trial [47] released in August 2019 differed somewhat from the results of the BIOFLOW II and BIO-RESORT small-vessel subgroups. The ≤2.75-mm small-vessel cutoff used in BIOFLOW II and BIO- RESORT, versus the deﬁnition of ≤3 mm or N 3 mm to deﬁne small- versus large-vessel disease used in BIOSCIENCE, potentially accounts for the discrepant results. Five-year rates of TLF were not found to be signiﬁcantly different between the BP-SES and DP-EES groups (22.3% vs. 18.3%, respectively; rate ratio 1.22, 95% CI 0.94–1.58, p = 0.13) [47]. Fig. 3.

Forrestal et al. / Cardiovascular Revascularization Medicine 21 (2020) 540–548\f2.3.5. In-stent restenosis Despite recent advances in stent technology, neoatherosclerosis due to inﬂammation, drug toxicity, and delayed vascular healing can result in revascularization rates of up to 10% [4,49]. The inert sil- icon carbide proBIO layer has the potential to improve biocompati- bility at the vessel interface and to reduce the proliferation of tissue, which leads to in-stent restenosis. However, to date, there are limited available randomized data on the efﬁcacy of BP-SES ver- sus existing second-generation DES in treating in-stent restenosis, with only 10 patients within the all-comer BIOSCIENCE trial and 30 within BIO-RESORT. Current European guidelines advocate for the use of drug-coated balloons (DCBs) or DES in the treatment of in-stent restenosis, but there are limited data on the efﬁcacy of latest-generation stents [50]. The BIOLUX trial [49] aimed to address this gap, randomizing 229 pa- tients with in-stent restenosis in a 2:1 fashion to receive treatment with a butyryl trihexyl citrate (BTHC)-based paclitaxel DCB versus BP- SES. In-stent LLL at 6 months and TLF at 12 months were compared be- tween both groups. Over the study period, DCB proved noninferior to BP-SES, with LLL in DCB arm reported at 0.03 ± 0.40 mm and 0.20 ± 0.70 mm in the BP-SES arm (p = 0.40). Rates of TLF at 12 and 18 months were also similar, demonstrating that both options seem fea- sible and effective but that further studies are needed in this challenging cohort of patients [49]. 2.4. Economic impact In addition to the improved clinical outcomes demonstrated in the BIOFLOW V trial, recent economic modeling has also suggested possible economic beneﬁts [51]. Markov economic modeling has shown that the reduction in rates of TLR and target vessel MI resulted in a cumulative reduction of $2415 per patient over a 48-month period compared to Xience [52]. With rising healthcare costs, these savings are an important consideration, not only for individual patients and insurance payers, but also for healthcare policymakers [51]. While caution should be exercised in interpreting this single sub-analysis, healthcare spending in the US alone is projected to reach 20% of gross domestic product by 2025 [53], so the delivery of safe, clinically effective and potentially eco- nomically viable treatments is an important consideration for any healthcare system. 3. Limitations The Orsiro BP-SES does have some notable limitations. The presence of the ultrathin struts may make the stent a less favorable choice in sit- uations requiring high radial force to prevent vessels recoil, such as CTOs, as described in a previous section. Additionally, data on the per- formance of the Orsiro BP-SES in heavily calciﬁed lesions is limited, mainly arising from small subgroups of “all-comers” trials, making any deﬁnite statements about the device's performance in this space difﬁcult. On a practical level, the ultrathin-stent struts can be difﬁcult to visu- alize using ﬂuoroscopy, so careful conﬁrmation of the stent position should be performed before deployment. 4. Future directions Several ongoing trials are continuing to investigate the efﬁcacy and effectiveness of the Orsiro BP-SES in comparison to other contemporary stents. The enhanced biocompatibility and ultrathin-strut design may also have a role to play in high-bleeding-risk populations by allowing for shortened dual antiplatelet therapy duration, which will be exam- ined in the planned BIOFLOW-DAPT study. With the favorable outcomes of the Orsiro BP-SES, ongoing developments in stent technology, such as the incorporation of CD34+ antibodies into bioabsorbable-polymer stents (COMBO™, OrbusNeich, Hoevalaken, the Netherlands), aimed at encouraging endothelial progenitor cell growth and vascular healing, are now being compared to the Orsiro BP-SES [54]. 5. Conclusions Overall, the Orsiro BP-SES has demonstrated its safety and nonin- feriority in numerous randomized clinical trials [1,3,14,20,48]. The combination of the ultrathin-strut design and inert proBIO silicon carbide layer allowing enhanced biocompatibility has demonstrated low rates of TLR against comparators and low rates of stent thrombo- sis. In speciﬁc high-risk subgroups, such as patients with STEMI and CTOs, notable exceptions have emerged, with lower rates of cardiac death and MI in STEMI patients [36], yet higher rates of TLR and major adverse cardiac events suggested in patients with CTOs [41]. Additional appropriately powered randomized controlled studies are needed to examine the role of the Orsiro BP-SES in other high- risk subgroups, including high-bleeding-risk patients, CTOs, and in- stent restenosis.

Orsiro features a hybrid coating of passive and active components: the PROBIO passive coating seals the metal surface of the stent and prevents interaction with the surrounding blood and tissue, while the BIOlute active coating contains a highly biocompatible polymer that delivers a -limus drug over 12–14 weeks and degrades gently over one to two years, thereby avoiding increased inflammation. The stent backbone is the PRO- Kinetic Energy platform, which has a double-helix stent design and thin struts, bringing flexibility and ease of deliverability.

Since the introduction of drug-eluting stents (DES), physicians have tried to find a delicate balance between achieving a highly effective result without compromising the safety of the patient. Various concepts have been introduced into the marketplace in the attempt to identify the optimal combination of characteristics; however, until now very little attention has been paid to combining a temporary drug therapy with passivation of the metallic stent that is left in the coronary artery. The Orsiro DES (Biotronik AG, Bülach, Switzerland) is the first hybrid DES, offering a unique hybrid coating consisting of passive and active components. The PROBIO passive coating encapsulates the stent and eliminates interaction between the metal stent and the surrounding tissue. The BIOlute active component is a bioabsorbable polymer matrix combined with a -limus drug that is released in a controlled manner, leaving only the PROBIO-coated stent in the long term. The hybrid solution with the PROBIO and BIOlute coatings is delivered using the underlying PRO-Kinetic Energy™ stent system with its thin strut design. This combination of effortless deliverability with a hybrid structure opens up a new generation of devices for improved patient outcomes. PROBIO Passive Coating The PROBIO passive coating seals the stent surface and greatly reduces interaction between the metal stent and the surrounding tissue and blood by acting as a diffusion barrier (see Figure 1). This thin-layer, amorphous silicon carbide coating is deposited onto the surface of the stent through a plasma- enhanced chemical vapour deposition technique. This process covalently bonds the inert coating to the metallic surface. Surface passivation aims to improve the biocompatibility of the material by reducing thrombogenicity and encouraging re-endothelialisation. The PROBIO coating achieves this passivation through its semi-conductive properties by reducing the interactions of protein/cell constituents with the stent surface. Lower diffusion of ions also leads to a lower rate of corrosion and a lower risk of tissue inflammation response as a result of allergic reactions.In vitro studies have shown up to a 96 % reduction of allergenic metal ion release when the stent surface is coated with silicon carbide. PROBIO is well known as it has been used for more than 15 years on all Biotronik-manufactured stents and has been implanted in more than one million patients. In the short term the passive PROBIO coating is covered by the active absorbable polymer coating, but nevertheless PROBIO serves a purpose since ion release can take place through the degrading polymer.

BIOlute Active Coating The BIOlute polymer base is made of poly-L-lactide (PLLA), a well- characterised bioabsorbable polymer that has been approved for medical use in a multitude of applications since the 1960s. The selection of this polymer was made after thorough screening of various polymer materials, both permanent and biodegradable. There are four essential requirements for a carrier polymer: biocompatibility; controlled release of the drug; mechanical stability able to withstand the plastic deformation during stent expansion; and ability to protect the drug from degradation during processes such as sterilisation and during shelf life. Essentially, the desired polymer is one that can provide safe transport of the drug through the vasculature without drug loss and ensure controlled drug release. Release can be controlled by such factors as polymer identity, formulation (drug:polymer ratio) and coating processes. The formulation and coating developed with the desired release properties have to show mechanical properties capable of withstanding implantation. In the development of BIOlute, from those polymers meeting the initial screening parameters, the selection was narrowed to focus on the criteria of biocompatibility as measured by local tissue responses in pig coronaries; this led to the selection of Poly- L-Lactidde (PLLA) as the polymer matrix of BIOlute. Another benefit of PLLA is that its slow degradation allows for full control of release kinetics since the polymer degradation is limited during the drug-elution period, which is not the case with polymers that degrade more quickly. The controlled release kinetics obtained with the homogeneous PLLA polymer matrix also means that Orsiro does not need to have any additional base or top coat, which is often required for other DES coatings. Another advantage of the prolonged gentle degradation seen with PLLA is that it minimises the inflammatory response (see Figure 2). After selection of the appropriate polymer, the next critical step in terms of elution kinetics was ensuring a uniform coating of the polymer and drug. The homogenous coating of the stent was realised using a unique coating technique. The mechanical stability is crucial for carrier systems of DES and BIOLute, due to the high strength of PLLA, is providing very good properties. The polymer thickness on the abluminal side of the Osiro device is 7.4 μm, one of the lowest among available DES (see Figure 3). On Orsiro, a circumferential coating rather than an abluminal coating was chosen to ensure that the polymer adheres to the stent platform even in the areas that face high stress during stent expansion. This, together with the strong mechanical properties of the polymer matrix itself, means that the risk of tearing off the coating as a result of stress during implantation and balloon dilatation is avoided. The highly biocompatible polymer gently degrades over one to two years, avoiding increased inflammation and ultimately metabolises into CO and H O via the Krebs cycle. Studies in minipigs have shown no residual PLLA and benign histology at 24 and 36 months. The biocompatible and gentle degradation is believed to lead to better patient outcomes. The sirolimus drug load is 1.4 μg/mm and the elution is optimised for clinical benefit to 12–14 weeks. (see Figure 4). In vivo studies have demonstrated that 50 % of the drug is released within 30 days and 80 % within three months (see Figure 5). The elution curve is adapted to the therapeutic window of the drug and is in line with that of other -limusbased stents. While studies have noted that -limus drugs as well as paclitaxel are effective in clinical use, -limus drugs have proved to be clinically superior with no significant difference between the different - limus derivatives. 3 4 5 2 2 2 6,7 Expert Panel Discussion View details Performed By: Babar Basir, Dan Burkhoff\fPRO-Kinetic Energy Stent Platform The deliverability and mechanical properties of the underlying stent backbone are known to be key success factor for any DES. To achieve this we use the highly deliverable PRO-Kinetic Energy bare metal stent as a platform for Orsiro. The PRO-Kinetic Energy cobalt–chromium stent platform has a double- helix stent design that allows for increased flexibility without compromising scaffolding or fatigue resistance. The helical meanders give flexibility to the stent for excellent delivery and allow for a smooth crimped surface without fish scaling. The longitudinal connectors provide stability to the double-helical structure for optimal scaffolding and support without sacrificing flexibility. The wedge-shaped transitions at the stent ends allow for scaffolding and flexibility throughout the entire length of the stent. All of these features of the double-helix stent design translate into increased trackability, crossability and ability to conform to the vessel wall. The cobalt– chromium stent material allows for thin struts while maintaining optimal radial strength and radiopacity. Orsiro is noted to have the thinnest struts compared with other DES, specifically down to 60 μm, varying with the available stent diameters of 2.25– 4.0 mm and lengths of 9– 30 mm. This ensures minimal wall injury, leading to better patient outcomes. Adding the polymer to the thin struts of the PRO- Kinetic Energy stent platform, the total thickness of the stent struts of stents with a nominal diameter of up to 3.0 mm is 71 μm – significantly lower than the thickness of competitors, including Xience (Abbott Vascular, Abbott Park, IL, US) at 95 μm and Endeavor Resolute (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, US) at 99 μm. The advanced stent crimping technology provides a low crossing profile (0.99 mm) and the optimised delivery system allows for higher-pressure inflations (mean burst pressure 24–30 atm depending on diameter; rated burst pressure 16 atm). Pre-clinical Results The safety of Orsiro was demonstrated in animal studies. A safety study of both the Orsiro and Cypher (Cordis Corporation, Bridgewater, NJ, US) stents looking specifically at histology and quantitative coronary angiography at four, 12 and 26 weeks in pig coronaries demonstrated that Orsiro with PLLA + sirolimus had a better safety profile than Cypher; the same was seen with an overdose model. Furthermore, an overlap safety study looking at four-week quantitative coronary angiography and histology showed that there was no difference in safety profile and drug effect in the overlapping region of Orsiro. A pharmacokinetic study up to three months showed comparable blood levels and coronary tissue concentrations to a -limus-based DES together with low organ tissue concentrations. A long-term polymer degradation study evaluating histology and histomorphometry up to three years was performed, demonstrating excellent biocompatibility and a lack of late increase in inflammation (data on file, BIOTRONIK AG, under publication). Clinical Programme Orsiro is supported by a comprehensive clinical programme consisting of a series of trials sharing the family name BIOFLOW. BIOFLOW-I is the first-in- man trial with 30 patients conducted in 2009 under the leadership of Professor Martial Hamon (University Hospital of Caen, France). The excellent results of the BIOFLOW-I study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01214148) are on par with other first-in-man trials of contemporary DES and was used for the CE- mark application. The results also served as input to the design of BIOFLOW-II (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01356888), a pan-European randomised controlled trial with 440 patients comparing the Orsiro with the Xience Prime stent that started enrolment in July 2011. BIOFLOW-III is a global, open-label registry that will enrol 1,000+ patients and will also look at pre-specified subgroups including diabetes, small vessels, acute myocardial infarction and chronic total occlusion. Enrolment is scheduled to start in 2011. Conclusion 8\fIn conclusion, Orsiro brings a new strategy to the treatment of coronary artery disease with a hybrid solution of active and passive components. The PROBIO passive coating provides a seal on the metal surface of the stent and the BIOlute active coating provides controlled drug release, with both components preventing an increased inflammatory response. The stent backbone is the PRO-Kinetic Energy platform, which provides flexibility with a double-helix stent design and thin struts. The clinical performance, which has been assessed in initial in vitro and in vivo studies, will be further demonstrated in forthcoming publications. References 1.

Methods: This was a single-centre, retrospective registry analysis that reviewed the clinical data from all patients who were implanted with a Resolute OnyxTM stent between March 2015 and February 2016. Clinical follow-up was performed at 1 year post-implantation. Results: A total of 252 patients received a Resolute OnyxTM stent and two patients were lost to follow-up. The mean age of the cohort was 66.9 years and 113 (45.2%) had diabetes mellitus. Thirty-eight patients (15.2%) had left main disease and 73 (29.2%) had three-vessel disease. A total of 175 patients (70.0%) had small vessel disease (<2.75 mm) and 210 (84.0%) had long lesions (>20 mm). The 1-year target lesion failure was 4.4% (11 of 250), cardiovascular death occurred in eight patients (3.2%), ischaemia-driven target lesion revascularization was undertaken in five patients (2.0%) and stent thrombosis occurred in one patient (0.4%). Conclusion: The Resolute OnyxTM stent showed a favourable 1-year clinical performance in a real-world population.

The latest version of R-ZES, Resolute OnyxTM , was launched in November 2014. This study investigated the 1-year clinical outcomes of patients who had received this new technology. Patients and methods Study design and population This was a single-centre retrospective registry analysis. From the launch of Resolute OnyxTM , all patients treated in the Division of Cardiology, Queen Mary Hospital, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong who had been ﬁtted with a Resolute OnyxTM stent between March 2015 and February 2016 were identiﬁed in the hospital database and recruited to the analysis. There were no exclusion criteria except patients lost to follow-up or those who could not be contacted for assessment at 1 year after stent implantation. Baseline demographics, procedural details and follow-up data were recorded. All treatment and clinical decision-making processes were subject to the attending cardiologists. The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of Queen Mary Hospital, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong (no. UW 17-026). Written informed consent was waived by the Institutional Ethics Committee as this was a retrospective analysis without any alter- ation in patient management. Study endpoints The primary endpoint was 1-year target lesion failure (TLF), deﬁned as a composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction (not clearly attributed to a non-target vessel), or a clinically indicated target lesion revascularization by percutaneous or surgical methods at 12 months. All clinical outcomes were deﬁned according to the Academic Research Consortium (ARC).4 Deaths were considered cardiac unless an unequivocal non-cardiac cause could be established. Secondary endpoints included individual components of the primary out- comes: target vessel myocardial infarction; clinically-driven target lesion revasculariza- tion (TLR), deﬁned as repeat revasculariza- tion within the stented segment including 5 mm proximal and distal border zones; clinically-driven target vessel revasculariza- tion (TVR) and stent thrombosis deﬁned according to the ARC as deﬁnite, probable, or possible.4 A revascularization was con- sidered clinically-driven if repeat angiog- raphy showed a diameter stenosis \u000250% with at least one of the following: (i) history of recurrent angina pectoris, presumably related to the target vessel; (ii) objective signs of ischaemia at rest or during exercise test by electrocardiogram, presumably related to the target vessel; (iii) abnormal test results of invasive functional diagnostic test (fractional ﬂow reserve); or (iv) a TLR with a diameter stenosis \u000270% even in the absence of the aforementioned ischaemic signs or symptoms. Study device Resolute OnyxTM (Medtronic Inc., Santa Rosa, CA, USA) is a zotarolimus-eluting stent designed for higher procedural success and better acute performance. The design is based on its predecessor, the ResoluteTM Integrity drug-eluting stent, which was extensively studied in the Resolute Global Clinical Program.3 In brief, the stent is manufactured using continuous sinusoid technology that employs a single strand of wire to form a sinusoidal pattern of crowns, 458 Journal of International Medical Research 46(1)\fwhich is laser fused at selected crowns. This distinctive wire-forming facilitates smooth tracking in tortuous vessels and allows excellent conformability.5 The drug polymer BioLinx is highly biocompatible with a hydrophilic surface designed to minimize inﬂammation.6 The polymer elutes the drug zotarolimus, which is a synthetic analogue of sirolimus, over 180 days, with >85% of the zotarolimus dose released by day 60.7 The latest version Resolute OnyxTM utilizes core-wire technology in which the cobalt alloy incorporates a platinum iridium core for increased radiopacity. Moreover, the strut thickness is further reduced to 81 mm (0.0032 inches) with maintained radial strength and the crossing proﬁle is 0.037 mm for the 2.5 mm stent. The Resolute OnyxTM stents used in patients included in this registry study ranged from 2.0 mm to 5.0 mm diameters and the stent lengths were up to 38 mm. Statistical analyses All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSSÕ statistical package, version 19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for WindowsÕ . Continuous variables are as mean \u0003 SD. Categorical values are pre- sented as absolute values or percentages. Comparison of continuous data was per- formed by one-way analysis of variance, Mann–Whitney U-test or independent- samples t-test depending on data distribution. \u00022 -test and Fisher’s exact test were used to compare categorical data. A two-sided P-value of \u00040.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant. Results From March 2015 to February 2016, 252 patients were implanted with Resolute OnyxTM stents. Two patients were lost to follow-up, so 250 patients completed the 1-year assessment and were entered into this analysis. A total of 577 Resolute OnyxTM stents were implanted. Baseline demograph- ics are presented in Table 1; 89 patients (35.6%) had type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), 24 (9.6%) had type 1 diabetes mellitus and 21 patients (8.4%) with end- stage renal failure (ESRF) were on dialysis (haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis). Interventional procedures and lesion details are presented in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. A total of 83 patients (33.2%) presented with acute coronary syndrome including ST elevation myocardial infarction and eight patients (3.2%) had cardiogenic shock. With regard to lesion characteristics, 38 patients (15.2%) had left main involvement, 73 (29.2%) had three-vessel disease; and 175 (70.0%) had small vessel diseases with Resolute OnyxTM 2.5 mm (n ¼ 164), 2.25 mm (n ¼ 111) and 2.0 mm (n ¼ 42) stents implanted. At 1 year, 228 of 239 surviving patients (95.4%) were on dual antiplatelet therapy. Table 1.

Tam et al. 459\fTable 4 shows the 1-year clinical out- comes. The primary endpoint of 1-year TLF was observed in 11 patients (4.4%). One patient suﬀered from ARC probable subacute stent thrombosis. When patients were stratiﬁed according to vessel size, the demographics and 1-year clinical outcomes were similar for patients with and without small vessel disease (Table 5). Of the 21 patients with ESRF who were receiving dialysis during the index procedure, ﬁve patients (23.8%) suﬀered from TLF within 1 year. Discussion To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report of the medium-term clinical perform- ance of the latest evolution of R-ZES, the Resolute OnyxTM stent. These present data demonstrated that the Resolute OnyxTM stent achieved similar eﬃcacy and safety compared with most contemporary DES with a 1-year TLF rate of 4.4%.1 In the Resolute All Comers trial,8 the Resolute zotarolimus-eluting stent and an everoli- mus-eluting stent had 1-year TLF rates of 8.2% and 8.3%, respectively. Although this current retrospective registry has its inherent limitations, this post-marketing study allowed the analysis of all patients including Table 2.

For example, this current cohort included patients with cardiogenic shock, patients with ESRF receiving dialysis, a high pro- portion of patients with T2DM and even patients who presented with cardiac arrest requiring haemodynamic support. This cur- rent cohort reﬂects real-world coronary intervention practices, which is diﬃcult to study in prospective randomized clinical trials. In this present study, many of the TLFs occurred in those ultra-high-risk patients and this further provides insight into the use of the Resolute OnyxTM stent in a real-world population. In the present study, 45% of patients had diabetes mellitus and 70% had small vessel disease. Small vessel stenting has tradition- ally been associated with higher rates of restenosis and repeat revascularizations.9,10 The degree of neointimal proliferation is relatively independent of the reference vessel size and hence the proportion of cross- sectional luminal narrowing is higher in small vessels compared with large vessels.11 The problem is further complicated by the presence of T2DM that predisposes to neointimal hyperplasia while patients with T2DM tend to have diﬀuse small vessel disease.12 These current data suggest that the Resolute OnyxTM stent had similar outcomes in small and large vessel diseases, which is similar to its predecessor stent as demonstrated by the Resolute Global Clinical Program small vessel subgroup analysis.13 Even in ultra-small vessels implanted with a 2.0 mm Resolute OnyxTM stent, the results were satisfactory and fur- ther studies will be required to investigate the optimal treatment of ultra-small vessel diseases. Of the patients in the current study who experienced TLF within 1 year, a signiﬁcant proportion were patients with ESRF receiv- ing dialysis (ﬁve of 11 patients). Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is known to be associated with increased mortality and morbidity from coronary artery disease.14 Particularly in those with ESRF on dialysis, who are frequently excluded from clinical trials, treatment failures are common after revascularization no matter whether percu- taneous coronary intervention (PCI) or cor- onary bypass grafting are performed.15 Even with second-generation DES, the 1-year TLF rate approached 15% and more than 30% needed repeat revascularization in longer term follow-up.16–18 In this current registry, ﬁve out of 21 ESRF patients (24%) suﬀered from TLF within 1 year, which is quite a high proportion. With the aging population, increasing prevalence of T2DM, CKD and better renal support, the incidence of coronary artery disease in patients with ESRF is set to increase. Further advancements in coronary revascularization technology including PCI and stenting is Table 5.

First, a lack of a control group prevents compari- son with other stents. Secondly, the small sample size and low event rates render conclusive outcome and independent pre- dictor analyses diﬃcult. Furthermore, the retrospective study design was subject to selection bias, although it allowed recruit- ment of a real-world PCI practice cohort and only two patients were lost to follow-up. In conclusion, the Resolute OnyxTM stent showed a favourable 1-year clinical per- formance in a real-world population.

AtriClip is a surgical device which is designed to occlude the orifice of the left atrial appendage to prevent any chance of clot formation in the appendage which could lead to stroke. Risk of stroke with atrial fibrillation The average person with atrial fibrillation, or AF, is 5-7 times more likely to suffer a stroke than someone with a regular heartbeat. In AF, the upper heart chambers quiver and shake rather than contracting, or squeezing, as they should. Because blood isn’t pumped out of the heart normally, it’s easier for blood cells to stick together and form clots in an area of the heart called the left atrial appendage. In people with atrial fibrillation, more than 90% of stroke-causing clots that come from the heart are formed in the left atrial appendage because it is a ‘cul de sac’ structure with a blind end. When a blood clot migrates out from the left atrial appendage it can potentially cut off the blood supply to the brain, causing a stroke. Left atrium in fibrilliation Aorta Left ventricle Site of clot formation in left atrial appendage\f4 What is atrial fibrillation? The heart has an electrical system that controls the rate and rhythm of the heartbeat. In a healthy heart, the electrical signals produce a steady heartbeat as the heart contracts and pumps blood regularly. When a patient is in AF, the electrical signals are disorganized which makes the two chambers of the heart (the atria) beat rapidly and irregularly (fibrillating). AF affects how well blood pumps through parts of your heart, which in turn affects your stroke risk. Proper treatment can help reduce the risk of stroke Types of stroke There are 2 types of stroke: ischemic (clot- related) stroke and haemorrhagic (bleeding-related) stroke. An ischemic stroke is caused by a blood clot that lodges in a blood vessel and cuts off the blood supply to the brain. This is the type of stroke most associated with the irregular heartbeat of atrial fibrillation. A haemorrhagic stroke is caused by bleeding in or around the brain. This can happen when a blood vessel in the area of the brain weakens and breaks. Blood leakage builds up and creates pressure on the brain, blocking blood flow. Causes of stroke Anyone can have a stroke regardless of age, race, or gender. But the chances of having a stroke are higher if you have certain stroke risk factors such as: • Atrial fibrillation • High blood pressure • Diabetes • Carotid artery disease • High cholesterol\f5 Atrial fibrillation and stroke facts • Stroke is the most common complication of AF • About one-third of people with AF will have a stroke • People with AF have 5-7 times the risk for stroke than people with normal heart rhythms • Strokes are more often fatal and disabling in people with AF • The left atrial appendage is the main source of stroke-causing clots that come from the heart Reducing the risk of stroke with AF The risk of stroke can be managed and this area of medicine has advanced greatly during the past 10 years. The most common way is with medications that prevent blood clots from forming and leading to a stroke. These medications, called anticoagulants or blood thinners, work well for many people. However blood thinning medications cannot be used in some patients for a number of reasons (usually excessive bleeding) and some new treatments have been developed to help these patients. If a patient does not tolerate a blood thinner then a specialist may recommend left atrial appendage closure: A procedure called left atrial appendage closure provides an alternative to blood thinners in highly selected patients. The left atrial appendage is a small pouch at the top of the heart.\f6 What is AtriClip ? AtriClip is a clip made from titanium metal and covered by a cloth which helps the AtriClip become incorporated into the tissues of the heart. A cardiac surgeon with expertise in key-hole procedures places the AtriClip on the outside of the heart to seal off the opening of the left atrial appendage. This is a brief procedure involving three small keyhole incisions less than 1cm long. The design allows it to be introduced via keyhole on the left side of the chest allowing for quick recovery and short hospital stay. This permanent AtriClip heart implant effectively reduces the risk of stroke without the risk of bleeding that can come with the long-term use of blood thinners. The AtriClip implant is designed to permanently close off the left atrial appendage and keep those blood clots from escaping. Since this device is placed on the outside of the heart, it is not in contact with blood. Unlike other devices which are placed inside the heart this device does not require any need for blood thinners. However, Prof Weerasooriya will make the final recommendation depending on your health history. AtriClip is the only device of its kind approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the TGA in Australia. More than 200,000 AtriClip procedures have been performed worldwide. And with over 10 years of worldwide clinical studies behind it, AtriClip has a proven safety record.\f7 Determining cost and coverage AtriClip is not yet covered by every private health insurer, but an increasing number of them will cover it on a case-by-case basis. It is important to determine the level of cover as there may also be some out of pocket expense for surgery. This should be discussed with your surgeon prior to the procedure. Pre-procedure workup You will need to stop your anticoagulation medications 2-3 days prior to surgery as guided by the surgeon. Patients will need to have an echocardiogram within 3 months of the procedure. Prof Weerasooriya or surgeon may request additional tests based on your health profile. Patients also need blood tests and a chest x-ray at the pre-admission clinic at the hospital. You will meet your anaesthetist and get a chance to discuss any questions you may have. Body hair on the chest area may be clipped in preparation for surgery. On the day of the AtriClip procedure During the AtriClip, the patient will be under a general anaesthetic administered by a cardiac anaesthetist using an IV line. Once the patient is anaesthetised monitoring lines are inserted. A urinary catheter is generally not inserted. The cardiac anaesthetist will perform transesophageal echocardiogram (TOE) to check for blood clots in the heart. The procedure will be abandoned in the unlikely event of any clots detected in the heart. TransOesophageal Echo (TOE) A Transoesophageal Echo is an ultrasound procedure where a probe is placed down your oesophagus (food pipe) to take high quality images of your heart. Medication is administered to make you drowsy and more comfortable. The TOE procedure is performed in a hospital as a day case and takes 3-4 hours (including recovery).\f8 The surgeon will then make a 3 small incisions (1-1.5cm) on the left side of the chest. The AtriClip device comes with a special delivery system to deploy the device over the left atrial appendage. This usually takes less than 30 minutes. The patient will be woken after the procedure is completed. Scapula Posterior port Camera port Access port Appendage Appendage clipped LEFT ATRIAL APPENDAGE\f9 After the procedure As the procedure done as keyhole, the patient is woken up straight after the procedure and returned to the ward instead of ICU or CCU. During this time, the heart rate, heart rhythm, blood pressure, and oxygen level will be continuously monitored carefully. An IV will administer fluids and medication will be prescribed to manage the pain. The ward nurse will assess your pain on a scale of 1 to 10 and administer pain killers appropriately. Please ask for additional pain killers if you are experiencing pain. The day following procedure your nursing team will help the patient sit in chair and also walk in the corridor to assist in recovery from surgery. The cardiac surgeon will talk to you about the procedure on the following day and you can discuss any questions you have. Prof Weerasooriya is available to visit you in hospital after the procedure however this is usually not required. Your hospital stay is estimated to be 2 days after surgery but can be prolonged in some situations. On the day of discharge The patient will have a list of medications as well as referrals for a TOE (to be done in 2 weeks at Cardio Vascular Services) and cardiac CT (to be done in 4 weeks at Perth Radiological Clinic). The patient will have a dressing over the three incisions on the left side of the chest which can be removed after 2 weeks, the stitches will be removed by your GP after 5 days. The patient will have an appointment to see Prof Weerasooriya 2-3 weeks after the procedure, and with the cardiac surgeon after 4 weeks. Post discharge care Patients will be given discharge instructions which need to be read carefully. This will include the following: Not using ointments or creams on the wounds. If you have any unusual pain or redness, please visit your GP and also notify the cardiac surgeon. Taking showers with care. Patients must not go swimming or use a bathtub for 2-3 weeks until the wounds are completely healed.\f10 Staying active at home and resting between activity. It is not uncommon for patients to feel tired easily and they should see gradual improvement in stamina. Patients are not allowed to drive a motor vehicle for 2 weeks after the procedure. Complications Fortunately, these are uncommon given the nature of the procedure. The most relevant complications are: 1. Cardiac perforation or injury – any procedure on the heart has this risk. It is quite an uncommon complication, however the management of this requires sternotomy (breastbone incision) and repair of the injury. The procedure is performed by Cardiac surgeon who are trained and capable of dealing with this complications 2. Pericarditis – The pericardium is a sac around heart. To gain access to heart, the surgeon will incise the sac and the instruments and catheter used during procedure can rub against the sac. This and other aspects of the procedure leads to inflammation of the sac which is called “pericarditis” (inflammation of the pericardium). These complications can manifest as pain, fever, fluid build-up in the pericardial sac. Please contact Prof Weerasooriya with concerns about this/ 3. Stroke – Although very rare it is worth a mention. It can result during or after the procedure due to pre-existing small clots. You will have an intraoperative TOE to assess and confirm the absence of any before the procedure. After surgery, you will be commenced on blood thinners to prevent clot formation in the heart. 4. Pericardial effusion – This is the fluid build-up around heart. This can occur secondary to inflammation of the pericardium. Depending on its size, we may observe it or aspirate it with a needle. This can occur after you are discharged. It can cause shortness of breath, fever, flu like symptoms, sweats or fast heartbeat. Please contact Prof Weerasooriya if you experience any of these symptoms.\f\fHEART RHYTHM CLINIC Telephone 08 9386 4782 Fax 08 9389 1600 E-mail reception@heartrc.com.au Web www.heartrc.com.au Address Hollywood Private Hospital PO Box 691 Nedlands 6909",

BACKGROUND: Left atrial appendage (LAA) occlusion provides an alternative to oral anticoagulation for thromboembolic risk reduction in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Since regulatory approval in 2015, the WATCHMAN device has been the only LAA closure device available for clinical use in the United States. The PINNACLE FLX study (Protection Against Embolism for Nonvalvular AF Patients: Investigational Device Evaluation of the Watchman FLX LAA Closure Technology) evaluated the safety and effectiveness of the next-generation WATCHMAN FLX LAA closure device in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation in whom oral anticoagulation is indicated, but who have an appropriate rationale to seek a nonpharmaceutical alternative. METHODS: This was a prospective, nonrandomized, multicenter US Food and Drug Administration study. The primary safety end point was the occurrence of one of the following events within 7 days after the procedure or by hospital discharge, whichever was later: death, ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, or device- or procedure-related events requiring cardiac surgery. The primary effectiveness end point was the incidence of effective LAA closure (peri-device flow ≤5 mm), as assessed by the echocardiography core laboratory at 12-month follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 400 patients were enrolled. The mean age was 73.8±8.6 years and the mean CHA2 DS2 -VASc score was 4.2±1.5. The incidence of the primary safety end point was 0.5% with a 1-sided 95% upper CI of 1.6%, meeting the performance goal of 4.2% (P<0.0001). The incidence of the primary effectiveness end point was 100%, with a 1-sided 95% lower CI of 99.1%, again meeting the performance goal of 97.0% (P<0.0001). Device-related thrombus was reported in 7 patients, no patients experienced pericardial effusion requiring open cardiac surgery, and there were no device embolizations. CONCLUSIONS: LAA closure with this next-generation LAA closure device was associated with a low incidence of adverse events and a high incidence of anatomic closure.

Primary Outcome Evaluation of a Next-Generation Left Atrial Appendage Closure Device Results From the PINNACLE FLX Trial ORIGINAL RESEARCH ARTICLE Downloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on October 22, 2022\fKar et al\b LAA Closure PINNACLE FLX Trial Circulation. 2021;143:1754–1762. DOI: 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.050117\b May 4, 2021 1755 ORIGINAL RESEARCH ARTICLE T ranscatheter left atrial appendage (LAA) closure has emerged as a minimally invasive therapeutic option to prevent thrombus embolization from the LAA in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). Several clinical trials and observational studies have es- tablished the safety and clinical effectiveness of the first- generation WATCHMAN LAA closure device for risk re- duction of atrial fibrillation (AF)–related embolic strokes in patients at high risk.1–3 Although the first-generation device is associated with a relatively low procedure-relat- ed complication incidence of 2.2% in current practice,4 there are still some limitations of the device regarding the size matrix, ability to fully recapture the device, risk of perforation, device-related thrombus (DRT) formation, and peri-device leak. In addition, further improvements in procedural safety with a similar or superior incidence of anatomic closure might improve the long-term net clinical benefit of LAA closure compared with oral an- ticoagulation. The WATCHMAN FLX (Boston Scientific, MN; hereafter referred to as next-generation LAA closure device) is a next-generation LAA closure device designed to address these limitations, enhance procedural perfor- mance, and expand the eligible patient population with respect to treatable LAA anatomy. In a US Food and Drug Administration Investigational Device Exemption clinical study, we evaluated the safety and anatomic effective- ness of this next-generation device in patients with NVAF with clinical indications for LAA closure. METHODS The PINNACLE FLX study (Protection Against Embolism for Nonvalvular AF Patients: Investigational Device Evaluation of the Watchman FLX LAA Closure Technology; URL: https:// www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT02702271) is a single arm, prospective, nonrandomized study across 29 investigational centers in the United States. This study was approved by an institutional review committee and the patients gave informed consent. The data and study protocol for this clinical study may be made available to other researchers in accordance with Boston Scientific’s Data Sharing Policy (http:// www.bostonscientific.com/enUS/data-sharing-requests.html). Patients were eligible for the study if they had NVAF and a CHA2DS2-VASc score of ≥2 for men or ≥3 for women, were able to take the prescribed postimplant antithrombotic medi- cation regimen, had a rationale for a nonpharmacological approach to stroke prevention, and had no other diagnoses that would require long-term anticoagulation. Full inclusion/ exclusion criteria are listed in Table I in the Data Supplement. To allow physicians to gain experience with the implant procedure, all sites were required to enroll 2 roll-in patients before enrollment in the main study cohort. The main study cohort represents the analysis population. An independent clinical events committee adjudi- cated end point events. The study was conducted in accor- dance with the International Conference on Harmonization Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and the ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was spon- sored by Boston Scientific Corporation and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov. All patients gave written informed consent. Procedure Description The basic steps of the procedure were similar to the implanta- tions of the current-generation device regarding the use of general anesthesia, femoral venous access for the transseptal puncture, use of guide wire and pigtail for sheath guidance and positioning, and device selection based on transesopha- geal echocardiography (TEE) and angiography.5 The next-gen- eration device was deployed into the LAA first by forming “a ball” (Figure 1) and either (1) unsheathing while maintaining the position of the ball, similar to the current device technique; (2) advancing the device distally out of the sheath until it was fully deployed; or (3) a combination of both of these tech- niques. Once the device was deployed, the operator applied forward pressure on the delivery cable for at least 10 seconds to engage fixation barbs and allow the device to conform to the appendage. If position were not optimal, the device could be partially or fully recaptured and repositioned both proxi- mally or distally using the “ball.” Conformation of Position, Anchor, Size, and Seal criteria were assessed, and the device was released similarly to the current-generation implant. Postprocedure Management After device placement, treatment with a direct oral anticoagu- lant (DOAC) was required through at least a 45-day follow-up, with apixaban or rivaroxaban strongly recommended. Patients were also prescribed concomitant low-dose (81–100 mg) aspi- rin. On evidence of adequate LAA seal (leak ≤5 mm) at the 45-day TEE evaluation, patients were directed to discontinue Clinical Perspective What Is New? • The PINNACLE FLX study (Protection Against Embo- lism for Nonvalvular AF Patients: Investigational Device Evaluation of the Watchman FLX LAA Clo- sure Technology) evaluated a next-generation left atrial appendage closure device in patients at high thromboembolic risk with nonvalvular atrial fibrilla- tion who were eligible for anticoagulation therapy. • The device implantation was successful without prohibitive safety issues and displayed effective appendage closure on transesophageal echocar- diography imaging at 12 months. What Are the Clinical Implications? • The left atrial appendage closure device met the pri- mary safety end point with 0.5% (2/400) of patients experiencing a safety end point event within 7 days postprocedure or at hospital discharge. • The next-generation left atrial appendage closure device met the primary effectiveness end point with a left atrial appendage closure incidence (<5 mm peri-device flow) of 100.0% at both 45 days and 1 year after the procedure (P<0.0001 versus pre- specified performance goals for both end points).

If a leak >5 mm was measured at the 45-day follow-up, patients con- tinued DOAC plus aspirin and were reevaluated at 6 months postimplant. If there were no leaks >5 mm at the subsequent follow-up visit, patients could forego dual antiplatelet therapy and proceed straight to lifelong low-dose aspirin. Postimplant follow-up visits were required at 45 days, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Outcome Measures The primary safety end point was the occurrence of one of the following events between the time of implant and within 7 days after the procedure or by hospital discharge, whichever was later: death, ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, or device- or procedure-related events requiring open cardiac surgery or major endovascular intervention such as pseudoaneurysm repair, arteriovenous fistula repair, or another major endovas- cular repair. Percutaneous catheter drainage of pericardial effu- sions, snaring of an embolized device, thrombin injection to treat femoral pseudoaneurysm, and nonsurgical treatments of access site complications were excluded from this end point. The primary effectiveness end point was the incidence of effective LAA closure, defined as any peri-device flow with jet size ≤5 mm per core laboratory–assessed TEE at 12 months. The secondary effectiveness end point was the occurrence of isch- emic stroke or systemic embolism at 24 months from the time of implant. Because not all patients had completed 24-month Figure 1. WATCHMAN and WATCHMAN FLX device comparison. Changes from the first-generation to the next-generation LAA closure device include an 18-strut frame for improved conformability, a single-component device preloaded into a delivery catheter to allows both full or partial recapture during implant, dual-row J-shaped anchors to maximize device stability, a low-profile threaded insert covered by a permeable polyester fabric to minimize metal exposure and reduce healing time, an atraumatic tip for advancement and maneuver- ability within the appendage, and a shorter length and wider sizing matrix to treat a wider variety of anatomies.

Other clini- cal events sent to the independent Clinical Events Committee for review and adjudication included all-cause death, stroke/ transient ischemic attack, systemic embolism, major bleeding events (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium 3 or Bleeding Academic Research Consortium 5), device embolization, device thrombus, device migration, or pericardial effusion resulting in an invasive intervention (eg, open cardiac surgery or pericardio- centesis/pericardial puncture). Statistical Methods Descriptive statistics are provided for patient demographic and baseline characteristics, procedural characteristics, and medication compliance. The incidence of major clinical events, device- or procedure-related serious adverse events, and the incidence of LAA closure are also provided. For the primary safety end point, a performance goal was established based on a clinically acceptable margin added to a composite event incidence of 1.68% derived from the observed safety event incidence in the cohort of patients receiv- ing a device in the combined PREVAIL (Prospective Randomized Evaluation of the WATCHMAN LAA Closure Device in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation versus Long Term Warfarin Therapy)2,6 and CAP2 (Continued Access to PREVAIL AF Registry)3,7 studies with CHADS2 score ≥2 or a CHA2 DS2 -VASc score ≥3. These 2 studies were used to support Food and Drug Administration approval of the previous generation LAA closure device. A mar- gin of 2.53% was added to establish the performance goal of 4.21%, corresponding to a maximum observable incidence of 2.5%. This margin was deemed clinically acceptable on the basis of the observed incidence of procedural complications. Assuming a 1-sided α of 0.05, a sample size of 400 patients provided a power of 92%; if using a 2-sided α of 0.05, the power would be 77%. For the primary effectiveness end point, the expected incidence of effective LAA closure was 99.4%, based on the incidence observed in the combined PREVAIL and CAP2 device patients with a CHADS2 score ≥2 or a CHA2 DS2 - VASc score ≥3. A Δ of 2.3% was then subtracted from the expected incidence of effective LAA closure to establish the performance goal of 97.0%, representing a minimum observ- able incidence of 98.8%. Assuming an incidence of attrition of 20% (ie, patients who do not have a 12-month TEE) and a 1-sided α of 0.05, a sample size of 400 patients provided 92% power; if using a 2-sided α of 0.05, the power would be 81%. RESULTS Study Population and Procedural Characteristics A total of 400 patients were enrolled between May 2018 and November 2018. Baseline demographic information is provided in Table 1. The mean age was 73.8±8.6 years, 35.5% of the patients were women, and most were White (94%). More than half of the patients presented with paroxysmal AF. The mean CHA2 DS2 -VASc score was 4.2±1.5 and the mean HAS-BLED score was 2.0±1.0 (Ta- ble II in the Data Supplement). Implant procedure success, defined as the suc- cessful delivery and release of a device into the LAA, was achieved in 395 patients (98.8%). The most common reason for an unsuccessful attempt (3 of 5 patients) was unsuitable anatomy (eg, attributable to excessive vascular tortuosity, inadequate position- ing, or insufficient anchoring). Two attempts were unsuccessful because adequate compression and seal could not be achieved. Procedural characteristics are shown in Table 2. All 5 available device sizes were implanted successfully in the study, with the 27-mm device being the most common- ly used. A broad range of anatomies were treated, with 11.4% of patients treated with a 20-mm device and 7.8% treated with a 35-mm device, sizes that are not available for the predicate device. The average number of devices used was 1.2±0.4 per procedure. The num- ber of partial- or full-device recaptures during implanta- tion, defined as partial or complete withdrawal of the device back into the delivery sheath, was 1.8±2.8 and 0.4±1.1, respectively. Postimplant Antithrombotic Therapy The most frequently prescribed DOAC postprocedure were apixaban (76.7%) and rivaroxaban (20.3%). Based on TEEs interpreted by the sites, 96.2% (379/394) of patients had an adequate seal and discontinued DOAC Table 1.

Of the remaining 15 patients (3.8%) who continued DOAC after the 45-day visit, an additional 7 patients were found to have adequate seal and dis- continued their DOAC after the 6-month TEE. The re- maining 8 patients (2.0%) continued anticoagulation therapy beyond 6 months based on physician discre- tion. On the basis of core laboratory analysis of the 45- day TEE, no patient showed a peri-device leak >5 mm, and all evaluable patients were therefore eligible to dis- continue oral anticoagulation. As per protocol, nearly all patients (99.5%) were treated with aspirin at hospi- tal discharge; most patients (96.7%) then transitioned to dual antiplatelet therapy after the 45-day follow-up through 6 months, and 85.9% of patients were on as- pirin monotherapy at 12 months. Clinical and Echocardiographic Outcomes Primary Safety End Point The incidence of the primary safety end point was 0.5%. The upper 1-sided 95% CI was 1.6%, below the performance goal of 4.21% (P<0.0001; Figure 2); the 2-sided 95% CI was 1.8%. Two patients had a primary safety end point event. One patient had an ischemic stroke 1 day after an unsuccessful LAA closure proce- dure. Multiple instrumentations of the LAA without successful device deployment was likely the cause of the stroke. Imaging confirmed multiple small emboli in the brain. The second patient had difficulty in writing and finding words 2 days after the procedure. Imaging was suggestive of a subacute ischemic stroke attribut- able to intracranial atherosclerotic disease, and the pa- tient was discharged 4 days later with minimal residual symptoms. There were no pericardial effusions requir- ing intervention before discharge or up to 7 days after the procedure. Figure 3 compares the safety results of the next-generation LAA closure device compared with the first-generation device used in the initial Food and Drug Administration trials: PROTECT AF (WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage System for Embolic Protection in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation), CAP (Continued Ac- cess to PROTECT AF registry), PREVAIL (Evaluation of the WATCHMAN LAA Closure Device in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation Versus Long Term Warfarin Therapy), and CAP2 (Continued Access to PREVAIL).

Table 3 shows LAA closure incidence for all implant, 45- day, and 12-month TEEs analyzed by the core labora- tory. At 45-day follow-up, 97.3% of patients (389/400) had evaluable TEEs, all of whom (389/389; 100%) ex- hibited adequate LAA closure. The peri-device leak was 0.03±0.22 mm and 0.57±1.26 mm at implant and 45 days, respectively. In all the cases where a device was implanted but the TEE was not evaluable by the core laboratory, peri-device flow was assessed as ≤5 mm by the site. Core laboratory 12-month follow-up data were available and evaluable for 344 patients, and, likewise, the incidence of LAA closure was 100% (344/344). No patients had a jet size >5 mm and 90% had no detect- able peri-device leak as assessed by the core laboratory. Major Clinical Events The Kaplan-Meier event incidence was calculated for Clinical Events Committee–adjudicated major clini- cal events (Table 4). Clinical follow-up was available for 100% (400/400) of patients at 45 days after the procedure, and 95.4% (355/372) of eligible patients at 12 months. A total of 4 patients experienced a peri- cardial effusion requiring intervention, representing a 12-month Kaplan-Meier incidence of 1.0%. Three effusions occurred between 7 and 45 days after the procedure, and the 4th effusion occurred at 340 days after the procedure after a cardiac ablation. A total of 25 deaths and 10 strokes occurred through 12-month follow-up; the 12-month Kaplan-Meier–estimated inci- dence for all-cause mortality and stroke was 6.6% and 2.6%, respectively (additional detail on deaths avail- able in Table III in the Data Supplement). There were no hemorrhagic strokes. There was 1 systemic embo- lism (0.3%), and no device embolizations. The trial is ongoing through 24-months of follow-up; however, at the time of this analysis, 12 strokes have been reported with 2 occurring after 1 year follow-up. Device-Related Thrombus Through the end of the 1-year follow-up window, 7 patients had a DRT with 4 discovered during scheduled follow-up TEE visits (1 at 45 days in a patient who dis- continued DOAC early and 3 at 12 months), 1 noted during a workup for a planned pulmonary vein isolation procedure and 2 observed as a result of a suspected embolic event. Of the 2 who experienced an embolic event, one patient presented with acute stroke 132 days after implant with a dissection flap in the carot- id artery, died the next day, and autopsy findings re- vealed a thrombus adherent to the device. The second patient presented with sepsis and was diagnosed with critical limb ischemia at 175 days after implant, and Figure 3. Safety event comparison. The next-generation left atrial appendage oc- clude device event incidence in PINNACLE FLX was 0.5%.

DISCUSSION The first-generation LAA closure device has been evalu- ated in multiple clinical studies and has been implanted in >100000 patients worldwide. Mechanical closure of the appendage is intended to help patients with NVAF to discontinue lifelong anticoagulant therapy for stroke prevention. Procedural safety and efficacy of the currently available device has been proven in multiple randomized trials and prospective registries with ex- tensive follow-up,3,6,8 and the incidence of major pro- cedure-related complications has improved over time and with increasing physician experience.4,9 However, improvements can be made to the present device to further reduce the incidence of pericardial effusion, de- vice embolization, peri-device leak, and device-related thrombus. The next-generation LAA closure device was designed to address these issues and was evaluated in the PINNACLE FLX study. The principal findings were that the device met both the primary safety and efficacy end points, showing a low incidence of periprocedural safety events and a very high incidence of effective clo- sure at 1 year (100%). The WATCHMAN and Amplatzer Amulet Occluder are the most used LAA closure devices globally, with only the WATCHMAN being available for clinical use in the United States. To minimize the risk of the major complications of LAA closure, pericardial effusion, de- vice embolization, and periprocedural stroke, the next- generation LAA closure device was developed. It com- prises a self-expanding nitinol frame with 18 peripheral fixation anchors (2 rows of 9) and a permeable polyes- ter fabric covering the atrial-facing surface. Unlike the predicate device, the new device is available in 5 sizes, but covers a slightly larger range of LAA diameters, from 14 to 31.5 mm, accommodating a wider variety of anatomies. The atraumatic closed distal end was de- signed to reduce the risk for perforation, along with 2 rows of J-shaped fixation anchors to provide control and stability of deployment, and the ability for full and partial recapture and redeployment. The 18- rather than 10-strut design along with an open architecture configuration allows the device to conform to the LAA ostium and reduce peri-device leak. The threaded insert in the center of the proximal face is recessed, decreas- ing the amount of exposed metal volume to potentially improve healing and decrease device-related thrombus. Similar to the predicate device, size and placement is determined by LAA measurements using fluoroscopy and TEE guidance. Last, the length of the device is re- duced, so that LAA depth is only required to be one- half that of the width of the LAA ostium, thus facilitat- ing treatment of shallower appendages. Pericardial effusion is the most common serious pro- cedure-related complication. In contemporary clinical studies, the incidence of early (<7 days) pericardial ef- fusion varies from 0.4% to 4%,10,11 and in the National Cardiovascular Data Registry LAAO Registry of com- mercial implants within the United States, in-hospital pericardial effusion requiring surgical or percutaneous drainage occurred in 1.4%.4 In the present study, there were no pericardial effusions requiring drainage in the first 7 days. Between 7 and 45 days, 3 cases required percutaneous drainage. The mechanism of these late effusions is unknown but could be attributable to mi- cropunctures of the LAA in combination with postim- plant DOAC therapy, which can lead to slow accumula- tion of blood in the pericardial space. Regardless, the closed atraumatic distal end of the device and newly constructed anchors may have contributed to these early favorable results. Device embolization is one of the most serious com- plications associated with LAA closure. The incidence of this complication using current devices varies ≈0.2% to 2%,10,11 whereas a more contemporary reporting from the National Cardiovascular Data Registry report was 0.07%.4 When embolization does occur, especially with larger devices, the device may be caught in the left ven- tricle requiring surgical removal. It is important to note that there were no early or late embolizations of this next-generation LAA closure device in this study.

DOI: 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.050117\b May 4, 2021 1761 ORIGINAL RESEARCH ARTICLE allowing for optimal deployment are design changes that may have contributed to this notable finding. Periprocedural stroke did occur in 2 (0.5%) patients, both of whom made a good recovery. The incidence of this complication was in line with the incidence report- ed in the literature that went from 0% to 0.9%.4,9–11 Both cases appeared unrelated to the device, because, in the first case, no device was placed, and in the sec- ond case, the likely cause was attributable to severe in- tracranial atherosclerotic disease. The primary efficacy end point of peri-device leak at 12 months was met, with no instances of >5 mm peri-device leak as adjudicated by the core laboratory in any patient at either the 45-day or 1-year follow-up TEE. In addition, only 17.2% and 10.5% of patients had any peri-device flow ≤5 mm in diameter at 45- day and 12-month follow-up, respectively. It should be noted that this compares favorably with the inci- dence of peri-device flow observed in the PROTECT- AF trial with the predicate LAA closure device, in which 40.9% and 32.1% of patients had peri-device flow at similar time points.12 In an analysis of the PROTECT AF and PREVAIL trials, no peri-device flow at 12 months was seen in 66% of cases,13 whereas, in this study, no peri-device flow was seen in 90% of cases. There was modest discordance between the magnitude of site-reported peri-device flow and that determined by the echocardiography core laboratory. The conformability of the new-generation device, and the ability to use the atraumatic tip to achieve optimal positioning, as well, likely contributed to the relatively high incidence of effective closure. Al- though small amounts of residual flow around LAA occluder devices have not been robustly associated with ischemic stroke or device-related thrombus,12,13 a relationship is mechanistically reasonable, and the high incidence of closure we observed may improve long-term clinical efficacy. Further clinical follow-up of the PINNACLE FLX cohort will provide greater in- sights into this possibility. DRT occurred in 7 patients after 12 months of follow-up; however, only 2 of these patients had an embolic event. Despite the adverse events, the over- all incidence of device-related thrombus compares favorably with the 3.7% of patients in whom DRT was reported in the predicate LAA closure device ex- perience.14 Furthermore, the postimplant regimen us- ing a 6-week course of DOAC and low-dose aspirin therapy, compared with the combination of warfa- rin and aspirin used in the PROTECT-AF and PREVAIL clinical trials, may have also influenced the findings. The pathogenesis of DRT is still likely multifactorial, including patient-related factors, postprocedure anti- thrombotic therapy, and actual device characteristics. Although the improved incidence of LAA closure and decreased titanium surface area of the central insert may have contributed to the results, firm conclusions about DRT are precluded because of the relatively small number of events, limited follow-up, and the nonrandomized nature of this comparison. Last, unlike previous studies, the 45-day postim- plant antithrombotic regimen consisted of aspirin in combination with a DOAC rather than with warfarin. The low incidence of periprocedural pericardial effu- sion and the absence of DRT in patients who were compliant with medication supports the use of a DOAC and low-dose aspirin as the standard postpro- cedural antithrombotic regimen. Study Limitations Our study has several limitations. First, the study was not randomized to a control group; the procedural safety and efficacy of closure of the next-generation LAA closure device was not directly compared with that of the predicate device, and clinical event incidence with the first-generation device cannot be directly compared with a similar population treated with oral anticoagulation. Second, we report the incidence of anatomic and effective closure that are surrogates for the clinical outcomes of stroke and systemic embolism; these outcomes and others will be reported when the prespecified 2-year follow-up is complete. Third, our re- sults should not be generalized to patients who have absolute contraindications to oral anticoagulant ther- apy. Last, the study sample size was not large enough to provide robust estimates of the incidence of rare events, such as device embolization. Conclusions The PINNACLE FLX study results demonstrate that the next-generation LAA closure device, in combination with a 6-week postprocedural regimen of a DOAC and low-dose aspirin, is associated with a low incidence of safety events and high incidence of effective append- age closure.

However use of these agents is associated with increased risk for bleeding and is not suitable for those with contraindications to oral anticoagulation. Surgical LAA exclusion was commonly done during Cox-Maze procedure and mitral valve surgery. Progressively newer and less invasive techniques have been developed for LAA exclusion.LARIAT is a novel,minimally invasive endo-epicardial LAA exclusion technique and in this review article we discuss the rationale for LAA exclusion, LARIAT technique and its advantages compared to other LAA exclusion strategies. LAA Morphology and Functions The LAA is a remnant of the primitive left atrium,which is formed during the 3rd week of gestation. The LAA is a long tubular, often multi-lobed and trabeculated structure, which opens into the left atrium by means of an ostium between the left superior pulmonary vein and the mitral annulus.6 Morphologically, the LAA can be classified into 4 different types based on its external appearance: 1. Wind Sock: In this type, the primary lobe is the dominant part of the LAA. 2. Chicken Wing: In this type of LAA, the dominant lobe is bent at an angle at some distance from the ostium. 3. Broccoli: The LAA has complex internal characteristics like the lobes of a broccoli. 4. Cactus: The LAA has a dominant lobe and secondary lobes extend from the central lobe.7 Internally the LAA morphology is complex and highly heterogeneous. This internal morphology is the ideal substrate for thrombus formation in AF wherein there is reduced contractility of the left atrium. The ostium of the LAA is located between the left superior pulmonary vein and the mitral valve annulus. Physiologically, the LAA acts as a decompression chamber during states of elevated left atrial filling pressures. The endothelial lining of the LAA also contains cells rich in atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP).The LAA may therefore help maintain fluid balance in states State Of The Art In Left Atrial Appendage Ligation - The Lariat Abstract Percutaneous left atrial appendage ligation (LAA) techniques have come to the forefront of management of atrial fibrillation (AF) patients who are at high risk of stroke and are unsuitable for oral anticoagulation therapy. LARIAT is a novel percutaneous endo-epicardial ligation technique for LAA exclusion. This technique is increasingly becoming popular for LAA exclusion in AF patients. A few studies have validated the efficacy of LARIAT in mitigating stroke risk in AF patients with contraindications to anticoagulation. Additionally a few studies have suggested that AF burden decreases after the LARIAT procedure. In this review paper we discuss the indications, technique and the latest advances in the LAA exclusion using the LARIAT system.

Introduction Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained atrial arrhythmia, which results in significant morbidity and mortality.1 It is currently estimated that the prevalence of AF in the United States is projected to reach around 12 million by the year 2050.2 The main complications associated with AF are stroke and cardiomyopathy.3 AF increases the risk of hospitalizations and worsens the quality of life.The increasing prevalence of AF and the complications associated with it results in increasing socio-economic and healthcare burden on the society, of which stroke accounts for the majority of the burden. Patients suffering from stroke due to AF have prolonged hospital stay and are more likely to suffer from long term disabilities.4,5 Oral anticoagulation has been the preferred strategy for decreasing Disclosures: None Corresponding Author: Dhanunjaya Lakkireddy MD, FACC, FHRS Professor of Medicine Director, Center for Excellence in Atrial Fibrillation & Electrophysiology Research Bloch Heart Rhythm Center – Mid America Cardiology KU Cardiovascular Research Institute- University of Kansas Hospital & Medical Center 3901 Rainbow Blvd, Kansas City, KS 66160 Key Words: Left Atrial Appendage, Atrial Fibrillation, Stroke, LAA Exclusion, LARIAT.

The endocardial LAA exclusion is done using WATCHMAN and Amplatzer Cardiac Plug devices; several others are still in development.12-14 The epicardial LAA exclusion techniques includeTIGERPAW and AtriClip.15,16 LARIAT is a novel technique wherein the LAA is excluded percutaneously using a combined endo and epicardial approach and does not leave any hardware behind in the heart. Indications for LARIAT Procedure Currently the LARIAT procedure is being performed in patients with AF who have a high risk of stroke as assessed by the CHADS2 score and have contraindications to oral anticoagulation such as recurrent bleeding, history of bleeding in critical areas (brain, cavities) and patients who are at high risk of falls. Also, the LARIAT procedure may be performed in patients in whom oral anticoagulation is ineffective in preventing stroke. Pre-Procedural Assessment Anatomical assessment of the LAA is a critical component of the pre-operative assessment. In order to determine eligibility, the patient being considered for LARIAT procedure undergoes a cardiac CT. These CT images are then processed to construct a 3D CT image of the heart.The size, shape, morphological characteristics and orientation of the LAA are assessed for these images.The maximum diameter of the LARIAT suture is 40 mm and therefore the LAA maximal width cannot exceed 40 mm. Posteriorly directed LAA’s are also not amenable for LARIAT because the epicardial guidewire and the LARIAT suture cannot be engaged from the epicardial route. Additionally if the LAA is in close proximity to the pulmonary artery or trunk, there is increased risk of rupturing these vessels and hence this procedure is usually avoided in such patients. Additionally, this procedure cannot be done in patients with pectus excavatum, prior history of cardiac surgery, thoracic surgery, chest radiation therapy and pericarditis because of the adhesions.17,18 A transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is also recommended preoperatively, to assess the size of the LAA and also for exclusion of the left atrial- or LAA-thrombus. If a patient has thrombus, then anticoagulation is continued until the resolution of thrombus and then they can be considered for the LARIAT procedure once the thrombus resolves. All the patients undergoing this procedure need to be on oral anticoagulation for a few weeks before and after the procedure. LARIAT Procedure Bartus et al. first demonstrated the feasibility and safety of the LARIAT procedure in humans.19 The LARIAT system consists of the following components (Figure 1): 1) LARIAT suture delivery device 2) Magnet-tipped guidewires (FindrWIRZ® Guide Wire System) 3) Large occlusion balloon catheter ( EndoCATH® ) 4) SofTIP™ guide cannula 5) SureCUT ™ suture cutter Technique The procedure is performed under general anesthesia and in a hybrid suite with cardiothoracic surgical backup. Immediately prior to the procedure, a TEE is performed to rule out left atrial and LAA thrombus. During this procedure, the LAA is visualized in multiple planes to accurately assess and confirm the dimensions and of volume overload. Rationale for LAA Occlusion Nearly 90% of thrombi in non-valvular AF originate from the left atrial appendage (LAA).8 The anatomical and physiological characteristics of the LAA make it highly thrombogenic, especially during AF. Oral anticoagulation is effective in mitigating stroke risk in AF patients.9 Until a few years ago, warfarin was the only drug available for oral anticoagulation and subsequently novel oral anticoagulants (NOACS) have been developed and are increasingly being adapted in the management of patients with AF. However there is increased risk of bleeding associated with the use of warfarin and the NOACS. There is a 1.4% annual risk of major bleeding with the use of warfarin.10 Additionally, there is a high rate of discontinuance of warfarin. Adverse effects and limitations in lifestyle due to warfarin use are the main reasons for discontinuation of warfarin. Frequent monitoring of INR is needed in warfarin users and this imposes additional restrictions on lifestyle. Further, even in compliant patients the INR is often not within the therapeutic range. The Stroke Prevention using ORal Thrombin Inhibitor in atrial Fibrillation (SPORTIF) trials reported INR levels within therapeutic range of 2-3 only 67.5% of the time and that number is even lower in the community setting.9 The NOACS overcome several of the shortcomings associated with the use of warfarin. These agents do not need monitoring and do not have any interactions with food and therefore have fewer limitations on lifestyle. However, bleeding is still a concern with the use of these agents. Surgical LAA exclusion is a possibility and this is done during the Cox-Maze procedure for surgical treatment of Figure 1: LARIAT suture device components: A. Large occlusion balloon catheter B. Magnet-tipped guidewires C. Magnetic Guidewires aligned D. LARIAT suture delivery device E. LARIAT suture before tightening F. LARIAT suture after tightening\fJournal of Atrial Fibrillation 51 Featured Review www.jafib.com June-July, 2014 | Vol-7 | Issue-1 a guide wire is then carefully threaded into the pericardial space through the micropuncture needle. Therafter, serial dilators are used to dilate the epicardial access route and finally a 13 F soft tipped guide cannula is advanced into the pericardial space. The epicardial magnet tipped guide wire is then introduced into the pericardial space through the epicardial soft tipped cannula.This magnet wire is then carefully navigated towards the endocardial magnet tipped guidewire until both the wire tips attach to each other and align coaxially.This is the most important step of the procedure. The alignment is reviewed on fluoroscopy in multiple projections (Figure 2). Next the LARIAT suture delivery system is then carefully advanced over the epicardial magnet tipped guidewire.The advancement of the suture system is monitored carefully by means of fluoroscopy. If the magnets detach anytime during this process,then the LARIAT suture system is retracted and the magnets will be reengaged. Once this alignment occurs,the LARIAT suture system can be redeployed over the epicardial guidewire.This suture system is carefully advanced over the LAA over the coaxially aligned endo-epicardial magnet tipped wires until it reaches the ostium of the LAA. The EndoCATH® balloon is used as a reference for positioning the LARIAT snare at the ostium of the LAA (Figure 3). The position of the LARIAT snare is then checked in multiple views on fluoroscopy and also on the TEE. This is a very important step before deploying the suture. Once it is confirmed that all the lobes of the LAA are beyond the LARIAT suture, then the suture is deployed and tension is applied to tighten the suture. After deploying the suture, once again an atriogram is done to visualize the exclusion of the LAA.This is again verified by means of TEE. If this position is considered satisfactory, then the endocardial magnet tipped guidewire and the balloon catheter are withdrawn and further tension is applied to the LARIAT suture for several minutes using TenSURE suture tightener. If this position is not found to be satisfactory, then the LARIAT suture can be released and redeployed at a satisfactory location. Repeat visualization of the LAA is done on the TEE to verify the location of the suture (Figure 4). A left atriogram is also performed to check for complete exclusion of the LAA. Once this is verified, the suture is cut off using a suture cutter (SureCUT™ Suture Cutter). All the wires and sheaths are then retracted and a pericardial drain is placed and will be left in place for the next 24-48 hours. morphology of the LAA.Continuous intraoperative TEE is done for the entire duration of the LARIAT procedure. During the procedure anticoagulation is maintained by means of heparin drip and the ACT should be maintained at >250 seconds. Next the groin area is prepared and femoral vein access is obtained using the modified Seldinger technique. After obtaining the femoral vein access, a trans-septal sheath is introduced into the femoral vein and the distal tip is positioned in the right atrium. Next a Brockenbrough needle is introduced into this sheath.The inter-atrial septum is visualized by means of the TEE and under its guidance trans-septal puncture is performed. The Brockenbrough needle is carefully positioned in the distal part of the inter-atrial septum. The location of trans-septal puncture should be mid-low on the interatrial septum and should be directed posteriorly in order to gain easy access to the LAA. After visualization of the Brockenbrough needle on the TEE, the trans-septal puncture is performed. Immediately after the trans-septal puncture, an additional 5,000-10,000 Units of Heparin is given intravenously to maintain the ACT >250. Confirmation of the trans-septal puncture is verified by means of left atriogram as well as a bubble study. A pigtail catheter is then advanced over the guidewire into the LAA and the left atrial appendogram is done to visualize the LAA. Size and orientation of the LAA are again reviewed on the appendogram. After this an occlusion balloon catheter (EndoCATH®) is advanced into the left atrium and the LAA. A magnet tipped guidewire (FindrWIRZ® Guide Wire System) is then introduced into the occlusion balloon catheter and advanced into the LAA. The 15mm occlusion balloon has distal perfusion holes for angiographic purpose and LAA angiogram can be performed to mark the appendage and evaluate the position of endocardial guide wire. The endovascular magnet tipped guidewire is then carefully navigated to the most distal part of the prominent lobe of the LAA and is stabilized. Next steps involve obtaining the epicardial access. The subxiphoid area is infiltrated with local anesthetic and a micropuncture pericardiocentesis needle is used to gain access to the pericardial space under fluoroscopic guidance. The micropuncture needle is directed superiolaterally towards the left shoulder and about10-15° posteriorly under fluoroscopy guidance. The needle is carefully advanced and radiocontrast dye is injected through the needle to verify its position once it enters the pericardial space. After confirming the position of the needle with multiple fluoroscopy views (RAO and LAO views), Figure 2: Fluoroscopic images demonstrating LAA exclusion by LARIAT procedure. A.

Exclusion of the LAA after the deployment of LARIAT suture as confirmed by left atriogram\fJournal of Atrial Fibrillation 52 Featured Review www.jafib.com June-July, 2014 | Vol-7 | Issue-1 stroke and systemic embolism was 1.3% per year.20 The stroke rate was significantly lower than that observed in the National Registry of AF (3.9%).20 The combined end point of stroke, systemic embolism and death was 3.3% per year.20 The above data therefore suggests that LARIAT is effective in decreasing stroke risk in AF patients with contraindications to anticoagulation. Advantages 1.This is a minimally invasive procedure and therefore the patients can recover faster from the procedure compared to other surgical or mini thoracotomy based approaches such as the AtriClip.15 2. In this procedure an epicardial suture is deployed and there are no endovascular devices left behind in the LAA and therefore, theoretically, the risk of thrombus formation over the device or infections associated with the device should be low to none.18 3. There is no risk of device embolization like in the case of other implantable devices. When compared to implantable devices, with LARIAT device, there is decreased risk of device dislodgement or embolization and device failure.21 4. LAA also contains triggers for initiating AF and therefore exclusion of the LAA by means of LARIAT can also eliminate the AF triggers. Evidence to this effect has been seen in a few studies.22 The unipolar LAA voltage decreased from 1.1 ± 0.53 mV to 0.3 ± 0.38 mV after the LARIAT procedure.22 Similarly, the bipolar LAA voltage decreased from 4.7 ± 2.83 mV to 0.6 ± 0.27 mV.22 In the LAALA-AF study, the efficacy of LARIAT procedure as adjunct to AF ablation was compared with patients undergoing only AF ablation.23 In this study, the AF recurrence was 35% in patients undergoing LARIAT and AF ablation compared to 55% in patients undergoing AF ablation only.23 The above studies clearly suggest the role of LAA as a trigger for AF and LARIAT procedure offers the benefit of eliminating these triggers. Peri-procedural Complications Chest pain is the most common complication after the LARIAT procedure. Chest pain after the procedure was reported by 23.5% of the patients lasting for less than a day.21 Two of these patients were found to have acute pericarditis and were treated with non- steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.21 Perforation of the heart can occur while obtaining pericardial access, during engagement of the epi and endocardial magnet tipped guidewires and while deploying the LARIAT suture. This is an infrequent but fatal complication and requires immediate thoracotomy. Complications related to the procedure were seen in 3 (3.4%) of the patient’s in one study.21 Two patients had pericardial access related complications; one patient had a right ventricular puncture and the other patient had laceration of the superficial epigastric vessel.21 In one other patient, perforation of the myocardium occurred during trans-septal catheterization.21 Therefore, this procedure needs to be performed in a hybrid suite with cardiothoracic surgery backup. Pericardial effusion can occur from irritation of the pericardium during the procedure and also due to manipulation of the guidewires and trauma associated with the deployment of the LARIAT suture. This effusion is highest during the first 24-48 hours after the procedure and thus a pericardial drain is left in place at the conclusion of the procedure.Tamponade can also occur from perforation of the heart during the LARIAT procedure. Transientischemicattackorstrokeisapossibilityduetodeployment of catheters in the left atrium and therefore anticoagulation with heparin is recommended during the entire procedure to maintain ACT > 250 seconds. Denovo thrombus formation post LARIAT Post-Procedural Management After the procedure the patients are usually monitored in the hospital for 48-72 hours. The pericardial drain is typically removed after 24-48 hours. Post-procedure colchicine is recommended to decrease pericardial pain. Additional pain management involves a combination of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and narcotics for adequate pain control. A repeat echo may be done post- operatively to monitor for pericardial effusion. Once the pericardial drain is removed, the patients are monitored for 24 hours and then discharged home. Follow up Recommended follow up of patients undergoing LARIAT procedure is at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after the LARIAT procedure. Complete endothelialization of the surface of the excluded LAA is expected to be completed by 45 to 90 days after the LARIAT procedure. Inflammatory changes at the ostium of the LAA are anticipated from the deployment of the suture around the ostium and therefore routine anticoagulation is recommended during this time to decrease thrombotic risk. In those patients in whom oral anticoagulation is absolutely contraindicated, antiplatelet agents may be tried. A follow up TEE is recommended 45-90 days after the procedure to assess adequate sealing of the LAA, and if no residual leaks are found then the patient can discontinue oral anticoagulation. Subsequently these patients can be followed up in the clinic and a repeat TEE should be done in 6-12 months to check for any thrombus formation in the LA and to evaluate sealing of the LAA. Follow up imaging after 1 year can be done at the discretion of the operator. Efficacy of LARIAT The clinical efficacy of LARIAT in decreasing stroke risk was evaluated by Lee et al. These findings were presented at the Heart Rhythm Society annual scientific sessions 2014. In this multicenter study, a total of 138 patients were followed up for a total of 300.5 patient years.20 At the end of the follow up period, the incidence of Figure 3: Echocardiographic image showing the endocardial balloon catheter within the LAA prior to deployment of the LARIAT suture LA-Left atrium, LV-Left ventricle\fJournal of Atrial Fibrillation 53 Featured Review www.jafib.com June-July, 2014 | Vol-7 | Issue-1 LARIAT procedure was managed safely using the atrial septal defect occluder device. We used the 5 mm atrial septal occluder device in 5 patients who had a mean leak size of 4.3 ± 0.6 mm.Successful closure of the leak was observed in all of them. In another patient, we did a redo LARIAT procedure and were able to successfully exclude the LAA without any residual leak.30 Theoretically any residual communication between the left atrium and LAA should pose an increased risk for stroke. This risk would probably vary with the size of the leak and the flow parameters across the LAA orifice. However due to limited experience with the LARIAT device, the correlation between stroke risk and the size of the leak is not accurately known. Conclusion: LAA occlusion has been an area of tremendous interest for electrophysiologists, interventionists and cardiothoracic surgeons alike, with many catheter based and surgical procedures being developed and tested. It only augurs well for the patients who are at high risk of stroke and have contraindications to anticoagulant therapy that the newer procedures and techniques prove to be safe and efficacious. LARIAT procedure for LAA occlusion is a novel percutaneous technique and is increasingly being adapted. The procedure needs to be performed by highly skilled operators and should always be performed with surgical back up support. Besides decreasing the risk of stroke, it appears to offer the added advantage of elimination of the electrical triggers of AF.The safety and efficacy of the LARIAT procedure has been demonstrated in a few studies. This technique is yet to be adapted by the major cardiology professional organizations into the clinical guidelines for the management of AF. References: 1.

Garcia-Villarreal, O.A., Hands-free approach for the left atrial appendage in Cox procedure has been reported in a few cases.24-27 Thrombus formation was seen in 6 patients in whom thrombus was detected during follow up TEE. In 3 of those cases, thrombus was seen at the endocardial surface of LAA closure site in the left atrium.24-26 The thrombus was reportedly in the remnant stump of LAA after incomplete exclusion in the remaining 3 cases.24,27 There were no clinical embolic events reported from the above studies and thrombi were reported to be resolved after anticoagulation treatment.24-27 Due to this increased and unpredictable risk of thrombus formation post-LARIAT, anticoagulation is recommended for a period of up to 90 days or sooner if the follow up TEE demonstrates complete sealing of the LAA during follow up. Other complications include access site complications such as groin hematomas and pseudo aneurysms. Post-LARIAT Leaks in the LAA After deploying the LARIAT suture, complete sealing and endothelialization of the ostium of the LAA is expected to be complete by 45-90 days. However, incomplete sealing with remnant leaks may be a possibility in a few of them. Complete sealing of the LAA defined as leak <1 mm was seen in 95% of the subjects undergoing LARIAT procedure at 90 days and this improved to 98% at 1 year.21 Leaks varying in size between 1-3 mm was observed in 5% of the LARIAT patients at 90 days and by 1 year only 2% of the subjects had this remnant leaks.21 There have been isolated case reports where the leaks have been > 3 mm and various innovative approaches have been used to seal off these leaks.Yeow et al.reported a successful closure of residual leak after LARIAT procedure by GoreR HelexR Septal Occluder, which was primarily designed for occlusion of atrial septal defect.28 In another case series, Mosley et al reported closure of the LAA leak following LARIAT procedure using AVP-4 (Amplatzer Vascular Plug).29 In their case series, 3 patients had successful exclusion of the LAA leak using the AVP-4 plug.29 In our own experience, leaks less than 5 mm in size after the Figure 4: 2D Doppler Echo image demonstrating complete exclusion of LAA from the rest of circulation\fJournal of Atrial Fibrillation 54 Featured Review www.jafib.com June-July, 2014 | Vol-7 | Issue-1 maze IV.

In a one-time procedure, the WATCHMAN Implant effectively reduces the risk of stroke in people with atrial fibrillation not caused by a heart valve problem. Why the WATCHMAN Implant 1 Over 1/3 of people with AFib feel trapped between the fear of having a stroke and fear of the risks associated with blood thinners. In fact, more than 4 in 5 people with AFib taking a blood thinner (83%) say they would be willing to try a different treatment to help reduce their risk of stroke. As a permanent procedure, the WATCHMAN Implant doesn’t come with the same bleeding risks associated with the long-term use of blood thinners. This makes it an important option for people with a history or risk of serious bleeding on blood thinners. 2 3 If you have atrial fibrillation and you take a blood thinner to reduce your stroke risk, you’re probably aware of the bleeding risks that come with your medication. The longer you’re on blood thinners, the more you’re at risk for a bleeding episode. Hear about these real people who had serious bleeding events while taking blood thinners. In the following videos, they talk about their experiences, the effects on their families, and why their doctors recommended the WATCHMAN Implant.

DEVICE DESCRIPTION The WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure (LAAC) Technology is intended for percutaneous, transcatheter closure of the left atrial appendage and consists of the WATCHMAN Access System (Access Sheath and Dilator) and WATCHMAN Delivery System (Delivery Catheter and WATCHMAN Device). The Access System and Delivery System permit device placement in the left atrial appendage (LAA) via femoral venous access and inter-atrial septum crossing into the left atrium. The WATCHMAN Device is a self-expanding nitinol structure with a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) porous membrane on the proximal face. The device is constrained within the Delivery System until deployment in the LAA. The device is available in 5 sizes from 21 to 33 mm. Appropriate device sizing is determined by LAA measurements using fluoroscopy (fluoro) and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). The WATCHMAN Device is designed to be permanently implanted at or slightly distal to the ostium (opening) of the LAA to close the appendage to inflow. The placement procedure can be done under local or general anesthesia in a hospital cardiac catheterization or electrophysiology laboratory setting. User Information Intended users of the WATCHMAN Device are physicians who are trained in percutaneous and transseptal procedures and who have completed the WATCHMAN Physician Training program.\f2 Boston Scientific (Master Brand DFU Template 8.2677in x 11.6929in A4, 90105918AP), eDFU, MB, WATCHMAN, DEVICE, en, 90746221-01C Black (K) ∆E ≤5.0 Implantation of the WATCHMAN® Device should only be performed by these Intended Users. Contents Quantity \u0007 Description 1\t\u0007 WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure Device with Delivery System INTENDED USE/INDICATIONS FOR USE The WATCHMAN Device is indicated to reduce the risk of thromboembolism from the left atrial appendage in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who: • Are at increased risk for stroke and systemic embolism based on CHADS2 or CHA2 DS2 -VASc1 scores and are recommended for anticoagulation therapy; • Are deemed by their physicians to be suitable for warfarin; and • Have an appropriate rationale to seek a non-pharmacologic alternative to warfarin, taking into account the safety and effectiveness of the device compared to warfarin. CONTRAINDICATIONS Do not use the WATCHMAN Device if: • Intracardiac thrombus is visualized by echocardiographic imaging. • An atrial septal defect repair or closure device or a patent foramen ovale repair or closure device is present. • The LAA anatomy will not accommodate a device.See Table 46. • Any of the customary contraindications for other percutaneous catheterization procedures (e.g., patient size too small to accommodate TEE probe or required catheters) or conditions (e.g., active infection, bleeding disorder) are present. • There are contraindications to the use of warfarin, aspirin, or clopidogrel. • The patient has a known hypersensitivity to any portion of the device material or the individual components (see Device Description section) such that the use of the WATCHMAN Device is contraindicated. WARNINGS • Device selection should be based on accurate LAA measurements obtained using fluoro and ultrasound guidance (TEE recommended) in multiple angles (e.g., 0º, 45º, 90º, 135º). • Do not release the WATCHMAN Device from the core wire if the device does not meet all release criteria (see step 14). • If thrombus is observed on the device, warfarin therapy is recommended until resolution of thrombus is demonstrated by TEE. • The potential for device embolization exists with cardioversion <30 days following device implantation. Verify device position post-cardioversion during this period. • Administer appropriate endocarditis prophylaxis for 6 months following device implantation. The decision to continue endocarditis prophylaxis beyond 6 months is at physician discretion. • For single use only. Do not reuse, reprocess or resterilize. Reuse, reprocessing or resterilization may compromise the structural integrity of the device and/or lead to device failure which, in turn, may result in patient injury, illness or death. Reuse, reprocessing or resterilization may also create a risk of contamination of the device and/or cause patient infection or cross-infection, including, but not limited to, the transmission of infectious disease(s) from one patient to another. Contamination of the device may lead to injury, illness or death of the patient. PRECAUTIONS • The safety and effectiveness (and benefit-risk profile) of the WATCHMAN Device has not been established in patients for whom long-term anticoagulation is determined to be contraindicated. • The LAA is a thin-walled structure. Use caution when accessing the LAA and deploying the device. • Use caution when introducing the WATCHMAN Access System to prevent damage to cardiac structures. • Use caution when introducing the Delivery System to prevent damage to cardiac structures. • To prevent damage to the Delivery Catheter or device, do not allow the WATCHMAN Device to protrude beyond the distal tip of the Delivery Catheter when inserting the Delivery System into the Access Sheath. • If using a power injector, the maximum pressure should not exceed 100 psi. • In view of the concerns that were raised by the RE-ALIGN2 study of dabigatran in the presence of prosthetic mechanical heart valves, caution should be used when prescribing oral anticoagulants other than warfarin in patients treated with the WATCHMAN Device. The WATCHMAN Device has only been evaluated with the use of warfarin post-device implantation. PATIENT SELECTION FOR TREATMENT In considering the use of the WATCHMAN Device, the rationale for seeking analternativetolong-termwarfarintherapyandthesafetyandeffectiveness of the device compared to warfarin should be taken into account. See “Patient Counseling Information,” “Summary of Primary Clinical Studies,” and “Clinical Studies,” sections for additional information. Non-valvular atrial fibrillation is associated with an increased risk of cardioembolic stroke. However, there are many sources of thromboembolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. The WATCHMAN Device is designed to reduce the risk of thromboembolism originating from the LAA. Although thromboembolism from the LAA is a common source of stroke in this setting, it is not the sole source. Therefore, the WATCHMAN Device would not be expected to reduce the risk of ischemic stroke unrelated to cardioembolism from the LAA, and other potential risk factors for stroke should be considered (e.g., cerebrovascular disease, hypercoagulable states). Warfarin and other approved oral anticoagulants effectively reduce the risk of cardioembolic stroke and are the most commonly used treatments in at-risk patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Following a careful assessment of the safety and effectiveness of the available approved oral anticoagulants, the WATCHMAN Device is an option that may be considered in selected patients to reduce the risk of cardioembolism from the LAA. Selection among available treatment options must first take into account whether anticoagulation is indicated to reduce the risk of stroke based on CHADS2 or CHA2 DS2 -VASc scores. Next, in a patient who is deemed by their physicians to be suitable for anticoagulation with warfarin, physicians and patients should consider the rationale for implantation of the WATCHMAN Device as an alternative to long-term warfarin therapy. Specific factors may include one or more of the following: • A history of major bleeding while taking therapeutic anticoagulation therapy. • The patient’s prior experience with oral anticoagulation (if applicable), which may include an inability to maintain a stable therapeutic International Normalized Ratio (INR) or inability to comply with regular INR monitoring AND unavailability of an approved alternative anticoagulation agent. • A medical condition, occupation, or lifestyle placing the patient at high risk of major bleeding secondary to trauma. Some studies of patients with a history of falls, or at risk for falls and head trauma, have shown that the benefits of anticoagulation therapy to reduce the risk of stroke outweigh the risk of major, life-threatening bleeding. An individualized benefit and risk assessment should be made in such patients.3, 4, 5 • The presence of indication(s) for long-term warfarin use, other than non-valvular atrial fibrillation (e.g. mechanical heart valve, hypercoagulable states, recurrent deep venous thrombosis). Details regarding the indications, contraindications, warnings and precautions for warfarin and other oral anticoagulants approved for patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation are provided in their respective Instructions for Use. Of note: • The safety and effectiveness (and benefit-risk profile) of the WATCHMAN Device has been compared to warfarin and not to other oral anticoagulants that have been approved for patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. • The safety and effectiveness (and benefit-risk profile) of the WATCHMAN Device has not been established in patients for whom long-term anticoagulation is determined to be contraindicated. Specific factors that need to be considered for the WATCHMAN Device and implantation procedure include the following: • Overall medical status, including conditions which might preclude the safety of a percutaneous, transcatheter procedure. • Suitability for percutaneous, trans-septal procedures, including considerations of: • Cardiac anatomy relating to the LAA size and shape. • Vascular access anatomy (e.g., femoral vein size, thrombus, or tortuosity.) • Ability of the patient to tolerate general or local anesthesia. • Ability of the patient to undergo required imaging. • Ability to comply with the recommended post-WATCHMAN Device implant pharmacologic regimen, especially for patients at high risk for bleeding, i.e., the need for warfarin plus aspirin for at least 45 days post-device implantation, clopidogrel and aspirin through 6 months post-procedure, and aspirin indefinitely. PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Physicians should review the following information when counseling patients about the WATCHMAN Device and implant procedure: • The safety and effectiveness of systemic anticoagulation and localized percutaneous, LAA closure with the WATCHMAN Device • There are non-LAA sources of cardiac emboli and other etiologies of stroke that may result in ischemic stroke independent of LAA closure that should be considered. • The procedural risks associated with WATCHMAN Device implantation. Table 4 details the major clinical events related to the device or procedure as observed in the WATCHMAN clinical trial program. • The need for adherence to a defined pharmacologic regimen of warfarin and antiplatelet therapy following WATCHMAN Device implant • Clinical conditions may arise that require continuation or resumption of warfarin therapy following WATCHMAN Device implantation • The risk of the device implantation procedure plus post- procedure related bleeding weighed against the risk of bleeding on long-term warfarin therapy Additional counseling information can be found in the Patient Guide and in the clinical studies section of these Directions for Use. MR MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING Non-clinical testing demonstrated that the WATCHMAN Device is MR Conditional.Apatientwiththedevicecanbescannedsafely,immediately after placement of this implant, under the following conditions: • Static magnetic fields of 3.0 Tesla or 1.5 Tesla • Spatial gradient field of 2500 Gauss/cm or less • The maximum whole body averaged specific absorption rate (SAR) shall be limited to 2.0 W/kg (normal operating mode only) for 15 minutes of scanning • Normal operating mode of the MRI scanner The WATCHMAN Device should not migrate in this MRI environment. This device has not been evaluated to determine if it is MR Conditional beyond these parameters. 3.0 Tesla Temperature Information In non-clinical testing, the WATCHMAN Device produced a temperature rise of <1.1 °C at a maximum MR system-reported SAR of 2.0 W/kg as measured by calorimetry for 15 minutes of continuous MR scanning in a 3.0 Tesla MR system (Excite, Software G3.0-052B, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI). These calculations do not take into consideration the cooling effects of blood flow. 1.5 Tesla Temperature Information Non-clinical testing of RF-induced heating in the WATCHMAN Device was performed at 64 MHz in a 1.5 Tesla whole body coil MR scanner (Intera, Software Release 10.6.2.4, 2006-03-10, Philips Medical Systems, Andover, MA) and produced a temperature rise of <1.5 °C at an MR extrapolated SAR of 2.0 W/kg for 15 minutes of continuous MR scanning. These calculations do not take into consideration the cooling effects of blood flow. Image Artifact Information In non-clinical testing, the image artifact caused by the device extends less than 3 mm from the WATCHMAN Device when imaged with a spin echo pulse sequence and a 3-Tesla MRI system. The image artifact caused by the device extends less than 5mm from the WATCHMAN Device when imaged with a gradient echo pulse sequence and a 3-Tesla MRI system. MR image quality may be compromised if the area of interest is relatively close to the WATCHMAN Device. Optimization of MR imaging parameters is recommended. SUMMARY OF PRIMARY CLINICAL STUDIES Treatment with the WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure (LAAC) Device, a permanent implant intended to reduce the risk of thromboembolism from the LAA, was evaluated in subjects with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who are suitable for warfarin therapy. The pivotal WATCHMAN LAAC Therapy for Embolic PROTECTion in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation (PROTECT AF) study was followed by three additional studies in this population: a continued access (CAP) registry to the PROTECT AF study; and a second randomized study, the Prospective Randomized Evaluation of the WATCHMAN LAAC Device in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation Versus Long Term Warfarin Therapy (PREVAIL) study; and a continued access (CAP2) registry to the PREVAIL study. These four studies enrolled subjects that were deemed by their physicians to be suitable for warfarin, and warfarin was used in the post-procedure during the period of tissue coverage of the device. Table 1 shows a summary of study designs, number of study subjects enrolled, and planned follow-up for each study. 1 January CT, Wann LS, Alpert JS, et al., 2014 AHA/ACC/HRS Guideline for the Management of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation, A Report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society, Circulation, 2014; 130: e199-e267. 2 Eikelboom JW, Connolly SJ, Brueckmann M, et al.

PROTECT AF Key Eligibility Criteria Key Inclusion Criteria The subject is 18 years of age or older The subject has documented paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent non-valvular atrial fibrillation The subject is eligible for long-term warfarin therapy The subject has a calculated CHADS2 score of 1 or greater Key Exclusion Criteria The subject requires long-term warfarin therapy The subject is contraindicated for warfarin therapy The subject is contraindicated for aspirin The subject has a history of atrial septal repair or has an atrial septal defect (ASD)/patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure device Key Echo Exclusion Criteria The subject has Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) <30% The subject has intracardiac thrombus or dense spontaneous echo contrast as visualized by TEE within 2 days prior to implant The subject has a high risk PFO defined as a PFO with an atrial septal aneurysm (total excursion >15 mm or length ≥15 mm) or a large shunt (early, within 3 beats, substantial passage of bubbles) The subject has significant mitral valve stenosis The subject had complex atheroma with mobile plaque of the descending aorta and/or aortic arch The subject has a cardiac tumor The primary effectiveness composite endpoint was the rate of the composite of stroke (including ischemic and hemorrhagic), systemic embolism, and cardiovascular death (cardiovascular and unexplained). The primary safety endpoint was the rate of life-threatening events as determined by the Clinical Events Committee (CEC), which included device embolization requiring retrieval, bleeding events such as pericardial effusion requiring drainage, cranial bleeding events due to any source, gastrointestinal bleeds requiring transfusion, and any bleeding related to the device or procedure that necessitated a surgical procedure. The primary statistical objective was to determine if the Device group is non-inferior to the Control group with respect to the event rate for the composite primary effectiveness endpoint. A total of 800 subjects were enrolled in the study at 59 centers. The 800 subjects included 463 subjects randomized to the WATCHMAN Device group, 244 subjects randomized to the Control group, and 93 Roll-in WATCHMAN Device subjects. PREVAIL Study The PREVAIL study is a multicenter, prospective randomized controlled study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the WATCHMAN Device compared to long-term warfarin therapy. PREVAIL was a second pivotal, randomized study of the WATCHMAN Device, and the analyses of the primary endpoints included historical data from the PROTECT AF study. Key eligibility criteria are provided in Table 3. Table 3.

A total of 461 subjects at 41 U.S. investigational sites were enrolled from November 2010 through June 2012. The 461 subjects included 269 subjects randomized to the WATCHMAN Device group, 138 subjects randomized to the Control group, and 54 Roll-in WATCHMAN Device subjects. CAP Registry The CAP registry is a multi-center prospective non-randomized study allowing continued access to the WATCHMAN Device during regulatory review of the pre-market application for the WATCHMAN Device. Entry criteria were the same as the PROTECT AF study. A total of 26 centers (24 U.S., 2 European) actively participated by enrolling at least one subject in the study. A total of 566 subjects were enrolled from August 2008 through June 2010. The primary effectiveness and safety endpoints were similar to the PROTECT AF. CAP2 Registry The CAP2 registry is a multi-center prospective non-randomized study allowing continued access to the WATCHMAN Device during regulatory review of the pre-market application for the WATCHMAN Device. Entry criteria were the same as the PREVAIL study. A total of 579 subjects at 47 U.S. investigational sites were enrolled from September 2012 through March 2014. The primary effectiveness and safety endpoints were similar to the PREVAIL study.

CLINICAL STUDIES PROTECT AF Study Primary Objective: To demonstrate that the WATCHMAN Device is safe and effective in subjects with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who are deemed by their physicians to be suitable for warfarin therapy to prevent thromboembolism from the LAA. Design: The PROTECT AF study was a multi-center prospective randomized controlled trial comparing the WATCHMAN Device to long-term warfarin therapy. A 2:1 randomization allocation ratio (two Device subjects to one Control subject) was used with stratification by center. Main entry criteria included, but were not limited to, at least 18 years of age, non-valvular atrial fibrillation, a CHADS2 score of 1 or greater, and eligibility for long-term warfarin therapy. Following randomization,subjectswereassessedat45days,6,9,12monthsand semi-annually thereafter through 5 years. A non-randomized roll-in phase was added to permit physicians to become experienced with the WATCHMAN Device implant procedure. Subjects randomized to receive the WATCHMAN Device underwent TEE at 45 days, 6 and 12 months after successful implantation. Subjects randomized to the Control group were to remain on warfarin with INR monitored every other week through 6 months and monthly thereafter. The primary effectiveness endpoint was the rate of the composite of stroke (including ischemic and hemorrhagic), systemic embolism, cardiovascular death (cardiovascular and unexplained). The primary safety endpoint was rate of life-threatening events, which included events such as device embolization requiring retrieval, bleeding events such as pericardial effusion requiring drainage, cranial bleeding events due to any source, gastrointestinal bleeds requiring transfusion and any bleeding related to the device or procedure that necessitates an operation. The effectiveness event rate was defined as the number of events per 100 pt-yrs of follow-up. A Bayesian Poisson-Gamma model stratified by CHADS2 score was used for evaluation of the statistical objective. The first sequential interim analysis was performed after collection of 600 pt-yrs of follow-up, which included 300 subjects with one year of follow-up and 100 subjects with two years of follow-up. Subsequent analyses were allowed after each additional 150 pt-yrs up to a maximum of 1500 pt-yrs of follow-up. The criterion for establishing non-inferiority at an interim analysis required that the posterior probability that the primary effectiveness event rate for the WATCHMAN group being less than 2 times the event rate for the Control group be at least 0.975 (or equivalently, the upper bound of the equitailed 2-sided 95% credible interval for the rate ratio be less than 2). Enrollment: The study enrolled 800 subjects with 707 randomized and the remaining 93 participating in the WATCHMAN Roll-in group. Of the 707 randomized subjects, 463 were assigned to the WATCHMAN group and 244 assigned to the warfarin control group as shown in Table 5. Table 5.

Effectiveness: Results of the final 5 year follow-up representing 2717 patient years for the primary effectiveness endpoint of the composite of stroke, systemic embolism, and death (cardiovascular or unexplained) are displayed in Table 8. The primary effectiveness event rate was 2.2 events per 100 patient years for the Device group and 3.7 events per 100 patient years for the Control group, resulting in a relative risk or rate ratio of 0.61. The criterion for non-inferiority and superiority of the WATCHMAN Device vs. the Control group were met and were driven by the rates of hemorrhagic stroke and cardiovascular or unexplained death in favor of the Device group. The ischemic stroke rate numerically favored the control group. Table 8.

PREVAIL Study Primary Objective: To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the WATCHMAN Device in subjects with atrial fibrillation who are deemed by their physicians to be suitable for long term warfarin therapy. Design: The PREVAIL study was a multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled study comparing the WATCHMAN Device to long-term warfarin therapy. A 2:1 randomization allocation ratio (two Device subjects to one Control subject) was used with stratification by center. Subjects were eligible to participate in PREVAIL if they were at least 18 years of age, had non-valvular atrial fibrillation and were eligible for long-term warfarin therapy with a CHADS2 score of at least 2. Subjects with a CHADS2 score of 1 were also permitted to enroll if they had any of the following characteristics (consistent with the recommendations presented in the ACC/AHA/ESC 2006 Guidelines for the Management of Patients with Atrial Fibrillation): • The subject was female age 75 or older. • The subject had a baseline LVEF ≥30% and <35%. • The subject was age 65-74 and had diabetes or coronary artery disease. • The subject was age 65 or greater and had documented congestive heart failure. A roll-in phase permitted physicians to gain experience with the WATCHMAN implant procedure. Subjects randomized to receive the WATCHMAN Device underwent TEE at 45 days, 6 and 12 months after successful device implantation. Subjects randomized to the Control group were to remain on warfarin with INR monitoring every other week through 6 months and monthly thereafter. All randomized subjects underwent follow-up at 45 days, 6, 9, and 12 months, semiannually through 3 years and annually thereafter through 5 years. This study had three primary endpoints: • First primary endpoint: The 18-month rates of the composite of stroke (including hemorrhagic or ischemic), systemic embolism, and cardiovascular or unexplained death. The non-inferiority success criterion for the WATCHMAN group vs. the control group was a rate ratio of less than 1.75 with posterior probability of at least 97.5% (or equivalently that the upper bound of the equitailed 2-sided 95% credible interval for the 18-month rate ratio would be less than 1.75). • Second primary endpoint: The 18-month rates of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism excluding the first 7 days post-randomization. The non-inferiority success criterion for the WATCHMAN group vs. the control group was either: (1) a rate ratio of less than 2.0, or (2) a rate difference of less than 0.0275, each with a posterior probability of at least 97.5% (or equivalently that (1) the upper bound of the equitailed 2-sided 95% credible interval for the 18-month rate ratio would be less than 2.0 or (2) the upper bound of the equitailed 2-sided 95% credible interval for the 18-month rate difference would be less than 0.0275). • Third primary endpoint: The percentage of WATCHMAN subjects that experienced one of the following events between the time of randomization and within 7 days of the procedure or by hospital discharge, whichever was later: all-cause death, ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, or device or procedure-related events requiring open cardiac surgery or major endovascular intervention such as pseudoaneurysm repair, AV fistula repair, or other major endovascular repair. The following events were not included in the assessment of this endpoint: percutaneous catheter drainage of pericardial effusions, snaring of an embolized device, thrombin injection to treat a femoral pseudoaneurysm, and non-surgical treatments of access site complications. The third primary endpoint event rate was compared to a performance goal of 2.67%.\f7 Boston Scientific (Master Brand DFU Template 8.2677in x 11.6929in A4, 90105918AP), eDFU, MB, WATCHMAN, DEVICE, en, 90746221-01C Black (K) ∆E ≤5.0 A Bayesian approach based on a piecewise exponential model was used to evaluate the first and second primary endpoints based on time to first event. In addition, this approach included prior PROTECT AF historical data from subjects with the same CHADS2 enrollment criteria as the PREVAIL subjects (see Table 3, PREVAIL Key Eligibility Criteria) with a discounting weight of 50%. For the third primary endpoint, a Bayesian approach based on a beta-binomial model was used to incorporate historical data from the PROTECT AF study and CAP registry through a prior distribution (without discounting) from subjects with the same CHADS2 score enrollment criteria as the PREVAIL subjects. Enrollment: The study enrolled 461 subjects with 407 randomized and the remaining 54 participating in the WATCHMAN® Roll-in group. Of the 407 randomized subjects, 269 were assigned to the WATCHMAN group and 138 assigned to the warfarin control group as shown in Table 13. Table 13.

There were two analyses of the PREVAIL trial results: (1) a pre-specified dataset lock in January 2013 and (2) an updated dataset lock in June 2014. The term “PREVAIL Only” refers to data from subjects enrolled in the PREVAIL study without the prior PROTECT AF study information used in the Bayesian analysis. The pre-specified analyses were based on the data available at 6 months following the completion of enrollment. When this was achieved in the January 2013 dataset, the PREVAIL Only subject mean follow-up post-randomization was 11.8±5.8 months, and 113 of 407 (28%) randomized subjects reached or passed the window for their 18-month follow-up visit. As shown in Table 17, this dataset included 396.2 PREVAIL Only patient- years, whereas the discounted prior data borrowed from PROTECT AF included 618.8 patient-years. In the updated June 2014 dataset, the mean follow-up duration for PREVAIL Only subjects was 25.9±9.7 months, and all randomized subjects reached or passed the window for their 18-month follow-up visit [and 310 randomized subjects (76%) reached or passed the window for their 24-month follow-up visit]. The updated dataset follow- up duration for PREVAIL Only subjects increased to 860.3 patient-years.\f8 Boston Scientific (Master Brand DFU Template 8.2677in x 11.6929in A4, 90105918AP), eDFU, MB, WATCHMAN, DEVICE, en, 90746221-01C Black (K) ∆E ≤5.0 Table 17.

The Bayesian estimate for the 18-month rate ratio was 1.07 with a 95% credible interval of 0.57 to 1.89. Since the upper bound of 1.89 was not lower than the non-inferiority margin of 1.75 defined in the statistical analysis plan, the non-inferiority criterion was not met (the posterior probability of non-inferiority was 95.69%). In the June 2014 Bayesian analysis, the 18-month rate was 0.065 for the Device group and 0.057 for the Control group. The Bayesian estimate for the 18-month rate ratio was 1.21 with a 95% credible interval of 0.69 to 2.05. Since the upper bound of 2.05 was not lower than the non-inferiority margin of 1.75 defined in the statistical analysis plan, the non-inferiority criterion was not met (the posterior probability of non- inferiority was 92.6%).

Design: The CAP registry is a multi-center prospective non-randomized study allowing continued access to the WATCHMAN Device during regulatory review of the pre-market application for the WATCHMAN Device. Up to 30 investigative centers with prior WATCHMAN Device experience in the PROTECT AF study were allowed to participate. Study participants were required to be at least 18 years of age with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, have a CHADS2 score of 1 or greater, and be eligible for long-term warfarin therapy. Following baseline evaluation and device implantation, subjects were seen at 45 days, 6, 9, and 12 months and semi-annually thereafter through 5 years. The endpoints of the CAP registry were identical to those in the PROTECT AF study, but there were no pre-defined statistical hypotheses. The primary effectiveness endpoint was the rate of the composite of stroke (including ischemic and hemorrhagic), systemic embolism, and cardiovascular death (cardiovascular or unexplained). The primary safety endpoint was the rate of life-threatening events as determined by the CEC, which included device embolization requiring retrieval, bleeding events such as pericardial effusion requiring drainage, cranial bleeding events due to any source, gastrointestinal bleeding requiring transfusion, and any bleeding related to the device or procedure that necessitated a surgical procedure. Enrollment: A total of 26 centers (24 U.S., 2 European) participated by enrolling at least one subject. A total of 566 subjects were enrolled.

Serious adverse events related to the WATCHMAN Device or implant procedure are provided in Table 4. Device. Up to 60 investigative centers with prior WATCHMAN experience in the PROTECT AF or PREVAIL study were allowed to participate. Study participants were required to be at least 18 years of age with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, be eligible for long-term warfarin therapy, and have a CHADS2 score of at least 2. Subjects with a CHADS2 score of 1 were also permitted to enroll if they had any of the following characteristics (consistent with the recommendations presented in the ACC/AHA/ESC 2006 Guidelines for the Management of Patients with Atrial Fibrillation): • The subject was female age 75 or older. • The subject had a baseline LVEF ≥30% and <35%. • The subject was age 65-74 and had diabetes or coronary artery disease. • The subject was age 65 or greater and had documented congestive heart failure. Following baseline evaluation and device implantation, subjects were seen at 45 days, 6 and 12 months, semi-annually through 3 years and annually thereafter through 5 years. The endpoints of the CAP2 registry were similar to those used in the PREVAIL study, but there were no pre-defined statistical hypotheses. There were three primary endpoints (two effectiveness and one safety) as follows: 1) the rate of the composite of stroke (including hemorrhagic and ischemic), systemic embolism, and cardiovascular or unexplained death; 2) the rate of the composite of ischemic stroke and systemic embolism, excluding events occurring in the first 7 days following device implantation; and 3) the occurrence of all-cause mortality, ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, or device or procedure related events requiring open cardiac surgery or major endovascular intervention between the time of randomization and 7 days of the procedure or by hospital discharge, whichever was later. Demographics: A total of 47 U.S. investigational sites actively participated by enrolling at least one subject in the study. A total of 579 subjects were enrolled. The average CHADS2 score was 2.7±1.1, the mean CHA2 DS2 -VASc score was 4.5±1.3, the mean age was 75 years, and 61% of subjects were male as shown in Tables 35 and 36. Table 35.

OPERATIONAL INSTRUCTIONS Pre-procedural Instructions A baseline TEE should be performed to verify that a patient’s anatomy is appropriate for a WATCHMAN® Device to be implanted. 1. Assess the following through multiple imaging planes (0°, 45°, 90° and 135° sweep): • LAA size/shape, number of lobes in LAA, and location of lobes relative to the ostium. • Confirm the absence of thrombus (use Color Doppler and echo contrast as necessary). 2. Record LAA ostium and LAA length measurements (0°, 45°, 90° and 135° sweep). Measure the LAA ostium at approximately these angles: • at 0° measure from coronary artery marker to a point 2 cm from tip of the “limbus” • at 45° measure from top of the mitral valve annulus to a point 2 cm from tip of the “limbus” • at 90° measure from top of the mitral valve annulus to a point 2 cm from tip of the “limbus” • at 135° measure from top of the mitral valve annulus to a point 2 cm from tip of the “limbus” Measured maximum LAA ostium width must be ≥17 mm or ≤31 mm to accommodate available device sizes. Note: The maximum LAA ostium and LAA depth measurements determine device size selection. Procedural Instructions Equipment Needed for Implantation Procedure • Venous Introducer (optional) • Standard transseptal access system • 0.035 in guidewire (exchange length extra support) • 5F or 6F Angiographic Pigtail Catheter • WATCHMAN Access System (which includes the Access Sheath and Dilator) Implantation Procedure Note: Aspirin should be started one day prior to scheduled procedure and continued daily. Note: Use of fluoroscopy and echocardiographic imaging should be used when implanting the device (TEE is recommended as an aid in placing the WATCHMAN Device). Note: Patients should be fully heparinized throughout the procedure with a recommended minimum activated clotting time (ACT) of 200-300 seconds recorded after transseptal puncture. 1. Use standard percutaneous techniques to puncture femoral vein and insert 0.035 in guidewire and vessel dilator. Use a standard, commercially available transseptal access system to cross inter-atrial septum. 2. Exchange crossing sheath with exchange length extra support 0.035 in guidewire. Position guidewire in left upper pulmonary vein (LUPV) or loop in left atrium. 3. Prepare WATCHMAN Access System. Note: Inspect sterile package and WATCHMAN Access System prior to use. If sterile barrier, labeling, packaging, or device have been compromised in any way, DO NOT USE. A. Remove Access Sheath and Dilator from package under sterile conditions. B. Inspect prior to use to ensure no damage. C. Flush Access Sheath and Dilator with sterile saline prior to use. D. Insert Dilator into hemostasis valve of Access Sheath until the two snap together. Note: Do not tighten the hemostasis valve while the Dilator is inserted in the WATCHMAN Access System. The Dilator by itself will occlude the lumen of the WATCHMAN Access System creating hemostasis. Tightening the valve onto the Dilator may damage the valve threads, which can lead to subsequent difficulty in closing the valve and an incomplete seal, once the Dilator is removed. 4. Advance WATCHMAN Access System over guidewire into left atrium (LA). As Access Sheath nears center of LA, unsnap the Access Sheath from the Dilator, hold Dilator and advance Access Sheath into initial position in LA or ostium of LUPV. Precaution: Use caution when introducing WATCHMAN Access System to prevent damage to cardiac structures. 5. Remove Dilator and guidewire, leaving Access Sheath in LA or LUPV. Allow back bleed to minimize potential for introducing air before tightening valve. Flush the Access Sheath with saline. If continued back bleed is observed from the valve after the Dilator is removed despite attempting to close it, loosen the valve cap (counter-clockwise rotation) until the cap spins freely. Then re- attempt closure of the valve while exerting gentle forward pressure on the valve cap during closure (clockwise rotation) to ensure proper engagement of the valve thread. While these steps are being undertaken, manual occlusion of the valve opening using a gloved finger is recommended to minimize blood loss. Note: These steps may be repeated if necessary. However, if this does not mitigate the blood leak, the user should remove and replace the WATCHMAN Access Sheath before proceeding with the procedure. 6. Confirm LAA size and select appropriate WATCHMAN Device. A. Using ultrasound guidance (TEE recommended), measure LAA ostium width and LAA depth in 4 views (0°, 45°, 90°, 135°). B. Choose a device based on maximum LAA ostium width recorded. The LAA depth must be at least as long as the LAA ostium width. Use Table 46 as a guide. Note: LAA anatomy should accommodate a WATCHMAN Device as described in Table 46. Table 46. WATCHMAN Device Selection Max LAA Ostium (mm) Device Size (mm) 17 – 19 21 20 – 22 24 23 – 25 27 26 – 28 30 29 – 31 33 Note: Record multiple angles on cine with contrast prior to advancing Access Sheath into LAA. Use fluoro guidance while advancing pigtail catheter and while advancing the Access Sheath. Stop if resistance is felt. C. Carefully advance pigtail catheter through Access Sheath into distal portion of the LAA under fluoro guidance. Carefully advance Access Sheath over pigtail catheter until Access Sheath radiopaque (RO) marker band corresponding to device size (see Figure 4) is at or just distal to LAA ostium. Slowly remove pigtail catheter. Distal Marker Band 33 mm 27 mm 24 mm 30 mm 21 mm Figure 4. WATCHMAN Device Size Relative to Access Sheath Marker Bands 7. Prepare WATCHMAN Delivery System A. Remove Delivery System under sterile conditions. B. Inspect prior to use to ensure no damage to handle, catheter connections and device (through Delivery System). Note: If sterile barrier, labeling, packaging, or device have been compromised in any way, or Delivery System appears damaged DO NOT USE. C. Confirm that the distal tip of the device is aligned with the RO marker band on Delivery System. D. Flush Delivery System with saline removing all air and maintaining fluid throughout system. Open and flush proximal valve. Note: To avoid introducing air, apply pressurized saline bag to the side port of the Access Sheath, or submerge Access Sheath hub in saline. Saline may be dripped from Delivery System during introduction into Access Sheath by injecting through flush port. 8. Loosen hemostasis valve of Access Sheath allowing bleed back before inserting Delivery System. Note: Hemostasis valve should spin freely (fully open). Note: Tightening the valve onto the WATCHMAN Delivery System may damage the valve threads, which can lead to subsequent difficulty in closing the valve and an incomplete seal, once the WATCHMAN Delivery System is removed. 9. To avoid introduction of air, slowly advance Delivery System into Access Sheath under fluoro guidance. Precaution: Use caution when introducing Delivery System to prevent damage to cardiac structures. 10. Under fluoroscopic guidance, align the most distal marker band on the Delivery System with most distal marker band on Access Sheath. Once marker bands are aligned, stabilize Delivery System, retract Access Sheath and snap together as Access Sheath/Delivery System assembly. 11. Using fluoro and ultrasound imaging (TEE recommended) confirm position of Delivery System tip before deploying the device. Note: To inject contrast, a syringe or manifold must be attached to flush port of Delivery System. Precaution: If using a power injector, the maximum pressure should not exceed 100 psi. 12. If repositioning is required, unsnap the Delivery System from the Access Sheath and slowly remove Delivery System from Access Sheath. If necessary reinsert pigtail catheter to reposition Access Sheath. Reinsert Delivery System as described in Steps 9 and 10. 13. Deploy WATCHMAN Device by loosening valve on Delivery System and holding deployment knob stationary while retracting the Access Sheath/Delivery System assembly to completely deploy Device. Leave core wire attached. 14. Device release criteria: A. Position: Plane of maximum diameter is at or just distal to and spans the entire LAA ostium (See Figure 5). Figure 5. WATCHMAN Device Position and Size B. Anchor: Gently pull back then release deployment knob to visualize movement of device and LAA together. C. Size (compression): Measure plane of maximum diameter of device (See Figure 5). Use Table 47 as a guide. D. Seal: Ensure all lobes are distal to device and sealed, i.e., ≤5 mm jet Table 47.

Resistance will\f14 Boston Scientific (Master Brand DFU Template 8.2677in x 11.6929in A4, 90105918AP), eDFU, MB, WATCHMAN, DEVICE, en, 90746221-01C Black (K) ∆E ≤5.0 be felt as device shoulders collapse. Continue to advance assembly up to but not past fixation anchors. When resistance is felt a second time (anchor contact), stop, tighten hemostasis valve. Note: If device is retrieved past fixation anchors, recapture fully and replace Delivery System with a new system. Refer to Step 16. The WATCHMAN® Device and Delivery System are for single use only. Do not reuse or resterilize. B. Reposition Access Delivery/System assembly proximally and re-deploy by holding deployment knob and retracting Access Sheath until device is completely deployed. Leave core wire attached. Warning: Do not release the WATCHMAN Device from the core wire if the device does not meet release criteria (Step 14). 16. Full device recapture. Note: The WATCHMAN Device should be fully recaptured into the delivery system, removed and discarded if the device is deployed too proximal or does not meet the release criteria test. The WATCHMAN Device and Delivery System are for single use only. Do not reuse or resterilize the fully recaptured device. A. Advance tip of Access/Delivery System assembly up to face of device (do not unsnap). B. Fix deployment knob with right hand and gently advance Access/Delivery System assembly over shoulders of device. Position right thumb against Delivery System for stability. Resistance will be felt as device shoulders collapse. Continue to advance assembly until device is completely collapsed and fully recaptured (past anchors). C. Withdraw the device until distal anchors are proximal to the RO marker band, then tighten hemostasis valve. D. Unsnap Delivery System from Access Sheath while maintaining position. Slowly remove the entire Delivery System. E. Insert pigtail catheter to reposition Access Sheath in LAA if necessary. F. Repeat Steps 7-14 with new Delivery System. 17. WATCHMAN Device release criteria: Confirm proper Position, Anchor, Size, and Seal (PASS criteria), and then advance assembly to face of device. Rotate deployment knob counter clockwise 3-5 full turns. Confirm core wire is disconnected. 18. Remove Access Sheath and Delivery System based on parameters for hemostasis. 19. Use standard of care for post-procedure bleeding at access site. Post-procedure Information 1. Post-procedure warfarin therapy is required in ALL patients receiving a WATCHMAN Device. Patients should remain on 81-100 mg of aspirin and warfarin should be taken post-implant (INR 2.0-3.0). At 45 days (±15 days) post-implant, perform WATCHMAN Device assessment with TEE. Cessation of warfarin is at physician discretion provided that any peri-device flow demonstrated by TEE is ≤5 mm. If adequate seal is not demonstrated, subsequent warfarin cessation decisions are contingent on demonstrating flow ≤5 mm. At the time the patient ceases warfarin, the patient should begin clopidogrel 75 mg daily and increase aspirin dosage to 300-325 mg daily. This regimen should continue until 6 months have elapsed after implantation. Patients should then remain on aspirin 300-325 mg indefinitely. If a patient remains on warfarin and aspirin 81-100 mg for at least 6 months after implantation, and then ceases warfarin, the patient should not require clopidogrel, but should increase to aspirin 300- 325 mg daily, which should be taken indefinitely. Yes Yes Yes No No No *The Performance and timing of TEE to re-evaluate the LAA seal is left to physician discretion. 1 Day Prior to Implant Begin aspirin (81-100 mg) Implant Continue aspirin (81-100 mg) and add warfarin, adjusted to achieve INR of 2.0-3.0 until 45-day visit 45 Days Post-Implant Is LAA seal 5 mm?

Follow-Up Duration Has the patient been followed for at least 6-months post-implant with adequate seal? Follow-Up Duration Cease warfarin and increase aspirin (300-325 mg) Figure 6. WATCHMAN Device Implant Pharmacologic Regimen 2. At 45 days and 12 months: assess WATCHMAN Device with TEE. • Confirm absence of intra-cardiac thrombus. • Perform color Doppler assessment to include the device/ LAA border at the following approximate TEE angles (0°, 45°, 90° and 135°). Measure any residual leak around the device into the LAA. If there is evidence of an incomplete LAA orifice seal of >5 mm, continuing or restarting warfarin therapy is recommended. • If thrombus is observed on the device, warfarin therapy is recommended until resolution of thrombus is demonstrated by TEE. 3.
