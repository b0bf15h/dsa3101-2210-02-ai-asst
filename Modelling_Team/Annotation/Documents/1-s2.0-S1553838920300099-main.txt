Over several non- inferiority trials, the BP-SES has demonstrated itself to be a safe and effective therapy for obstructive coronary ar- tery disease. This article reviews the current evidence of the efﬁcacy of the BP-SES and examines its performance in high-risk populations, such as patients presenting with ST-segment myocardial infarction, chronic total occlu- sions, diabetes, and small vessel disease. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Introduction In recent years, a series of advances in stent technology has led to steady improvements in rates of restenosis and stent thrombosis and has reduced the need for repeat revascularization. The development of ultrathin struts, improvements in polymer biocompatibility, and the de- velopment of bioresorbable polymers have all aimed to decrease early stent thrombosis and reduce local inﬂammatory and hypersensitivity reactions, leading to reduced rates of in-stent restenosis, need for revas- cularization, and lower incidence of other adverse clinical events [1]. Biodegradable-polymer stents were designed to allow the steady and controlled eluting of antiproliferative drugs in the early phases of treat- ment. This mitigates neointimal hyperplasia [2] while at the same time, through the polymer's degradation, removing the nidus of inﬂamma- tion at the vessel interface that is thought to be responsible for the “catch up” phenomenon of very late stent thrombosis observed with early generation drug-eluting stents (DES) [3]. The Orsiro BP-SES is available in diameters of 2.25, 2.5, 2.75, 3.0, 3.5, and 4.0 mm, and is available in lengths ranging from 9 to 40 mm. Stents with diameters of 2.25 to 3.0 mm have a strut thickness of 60 μm, while stents with diameters of 3.5 to 4.0 mm have a strut thickness of 80 μm [4]. Drawing together recent technological advances, the Orsiro coro- nary stent (Biotronik, Buelach, Switzerland) consists of two distinct layers packaged around its metallic struts [2]. The innermost layer of the system consists of a cobalt‑chromium alloy PRO-Kinetic energy™ stent arranged in a double helix pattern, which is designed to improve ﬂexibility and deliverability. The middle proBIO™ layer consists of a silicon carbide coating that seals the metal alloy surface and reduces the allergenic interaction of metal ions with the vessel wall and blood pool [5]. Finally, the outer BIOlute™ layer is composed of a bioabsorbable poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) polymer contain- ing the antiproliferative sirolimus agent. The active BIOlute™ coating is distributed in an asymmetric fashion on the struts, with a thickness of 7.5 μm on the abluminal side and a thinner 3.5-μm layer on the luminal portion of the stent. Fig. 1 demonstrates the stent strut design. The PLLA polymer undergoes a hydrolytic reaction upon contact with the blood pool, causing the polymer to break down into CO2 and H2O via the Krebs cycle. The sirolimus load is 1.4 μg/mm2 [6] with the elution opti- mized for 12 to 14 weeks after implantation. Fig. 2 summarizes some of the key design features in comparison with other contemporary stent designs. In vitro studies have shown that within 30 days, 50% of the drug is eluted, and within 3 months, 80% is eluted. The PLLA degrades over 2 years, leaving the thin-strut cobalt‑chromium stent with minimal en- dothelial injury [5]. This hybrid approach of combining ultrathin struts, a passive intermediate layer, and bioabsorbable polymer is aimed at creating less ﬂow disturbance, limiting the long-term inﬂammatory Cardiovascular Revascularization Medicine 21 (2020) 540–548 Abbreviations: BP-SES, biodegradable-polymer sirolimus-eluting stent; CTO, chronic total occlusion; CI, conﬁdence interval; DCB, drug-coated balloon; DES, drug-eluting stent; DP-DES, durable-polymer drug-eluting stent; LLL, late lumen loss; PLLA, poly-L-lac- tic acid polymer; PP-EES, permanent-polymer everolimus-eluting stent; STEMI, ST- elevation myocardial infarction; TLF, target lesion failure; TLR, target lesion revasculariza- tion; TVF, target vessel failure; TVR, target vessel revascularization. ⁎ Corresponding author at: MedStar Washington Hospital Center, 110 Irving St., NW, Suite 4B-1, Washington, DC 20010, United States of America.

In larger stent diameters, where the comparative advantage of strut thickness is less (80 μm in stents with diameters N3.5 mm), the additional design features of the inert silicon carbide layer and biodegradable polymer may still confer beneﬁts in vascular healing and long-term inﬂammation in comparison with other contemporary stents of similar strut thickness. 2. Discussion Several investigator- and industry-initiated randomized controlled trials have examined the efﬁcacy and safety of the Orsiro BP-SES in re- cent years. Cumulatively, these trials have enrolled close to 30,000 pa- tients around the world and have examined de novo lesions, acute coronary syndromes, and high-risk subgroups such as small-vessel dis- ease, diabetes, and chronic total occlusions. Table 1 describes the key randomized trials and registries, which are discussed below, followed by an additional focused discussion on the Orsiro BP-SES performance in high-risk subgroups. 2.1. The BIOFLOW trials The introduction of drug-eluting stents (DES) brought about major advances in combating early restenosis but also raised concerns about delayed intimal healing and prolonged inﬂammation [7] at the site of implant, leading to late events such as stent thrombosis and in-stent re- stenosis [8]. The development of biodegradable-polymer stents was intended to reduce the local inﬂammatory response and allow im- proved endothelization, decreasing the risk of late events such as stent thrombosis and in-stent restenosis [9]. Starting in 2013, the BIOFLOW trials were conducted to examine the safety, efﬁcacy, and noninferiority of the Orsiro BP-SES against several leading second-generation DES. Re- sults of these studies were used to support regulatory approval for the use of the Orsiro stent system in Europe, Japan, China, and the United States. BIOFLOW I [6] was a ﬁrst-in-man study designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the newly developed Orsiro BP-SES hybrid stent system. The trial included 30 patients with de novo lesions and demonstrated a low rate of in-stent restenosis with late lumen loss (LLL) of 0.05 ± 0.22 mm over the 9-month follow-up period. Though small, the BIOFLOW I study demonstrated that there was merit in the technology and, more importantly, that it was safe, with no myocardial infarction (MI) or stent thrombosis reported. The follow-on BIOFLOW II [3] study was a prospective, international, randomized controlled, noninferiority trial that compared Orsiro BP- SES in a 2:1 allocation ratio with the benchmark stent of the day, Xience Prime (Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, California). The trial also included a subgroup analysis, which allocated patients to repeat optical coherence tomography (OCT) for disease occurring in small vessels (b2.75 mm di- ameter) and diabetic patients (n = 55). The initial 9-month follow-up data published in 2015 showed non-inferior LLL compared with Xience (Orsiro 0.10 ± 0.32 mm vs. Xience 0.11 ± 0.29 mm, pnoninferiority b 0.0001). Similar to BIOFLOW I, no events of deﬁnite or probable stent thrombosis were reported in the Orsiro BP-SES group (298 patients, 332 lesions) [3]. The 5-year clinical follow-up data released in 2018 showed noninferior target lesion failure (TLF) (Orsiro 10.4% vs. Xience 12.7%, p = 0.473) with signiﬁcantly lower mortality in vessels b2.75 mm (Orsiro 3.7% vs. 11.3%, P = 0.022), [10] suggesting that the 60-μm thin Orsiro BP-SES proﬁle may provide additional beneﬁt in small-vessel subgroups. The recent publication of BIOFLOW VI [11] in China conﬁrms the noninferior rates of LLL (Orsiro 0.05 mm ± 0.21 mm vs. Xience Prime 0.07 mm ± 0.2 mm) and TLF (Orsiro 2.3% vs. Xience 1.8%, p = 0.7505) when compared with Xience. The BIOFLOW III [12,13] trial built on the ﬁndings of BIOFLOW II and aimed to gather “real world” data on TLF at 12 months using a prospec- tive, open-label, registry-based design. Enrolling close to 1400 patients, the registry reported a TLF rate of 5.1% over 12 months (95% CI 4.0% to 6.4%), with a rate of 10% (95% CI 8.4% to 12.0%) in the 5-year follow- up study [12]. Low rates of stent thrombosis similar to previous trials were observed (0.2% at 12 months, 95% CI 0.1% to 0.7%). BIOFLOW IV [14] was designed as a noninferiority trial to allow reg- ulatory approval in Japan. A total of 579 patients with de novo lesions were randomized in a 2:1 fashion to receive Orsiro BP-SES vs. the Xience permanent-polymer everolimus-eluting stent (PP-EES). Patients for planned intervention and patients presenting with MI in the previous 72 h were excluded. A total number of 385 patients (441 lesions) were enrolled. Twelve-month follow-up data reported a noninferior rate of target vessel failure (TVF) in de novo lesions compared with Xience (Orsiro 5.5% vs. Xience7.5%, pnoninferiority b 0.0001). These data echoed the previous European BIOFLOW I, II, and III ﬁndings with simi- lar rates of TLF and stent thrombosis, demonstrating applicability of those ﬁndings to the Japanese population and facilitating Japanese reg- ulatory approval in January 2018 [15]. Five-year follow-up is ongoing, with results expected in 2024. With regulatory approval in hand in both Europe and Japan, the BIOFLOW V [2] trial randomized patients to receive Orsiro BP-SES or Xience in patients presenting for elective or urgent percutaneous coro- nary intervention (PCI) at 90 hospitals across 13 countries, including the United States for the ﬁrst time. The primary endpoint of the trial was TLF at 12 months. Of patients included in the study, 51% presented with an acute coronary syndrome. Although BIOFLOW V was powered as a non- inferiority trial, over the initial 12-month period, the incidence of TLF was signiﬁcantly lower in the Orsiro BP-SES group than in the Xience DP-EES group (Orsiro 6.2% vs. Xience 9.6%, p = 0.0399) and was likely driven by a lower rate of target vessel MI in the Orsiro BP-SES group (Orsiro 5% vs. Xience 8%, p = 0.0155) [16]. In order to improve endpoint detection and statistical signiﬁcance, the authors of BIOFLOW V incorporated the results of BIOFLOW II and IV and used a Bayesian analysis [17]. This pooled analysis showed a TLF rate of 3% in the Orsiro BP-SES group with a posterior probability for noninferiority of 100% and a posterior probability of superiority of 97% [2]. A subsequent landmark analysis of the BIOFLOW V data con- ﬁrmed that the statistically signiﬁcant differences in TLF and target ves- sel MI reported at one year persisted through two-year follow-up [18]. Shortly after BIOFLOW V's publication, the Food and Drug Administra- tion granted approval for use of the device in the United States [19]. 2.2. The BIOSCIENCE, BIO-RESORT, BIONYX, and SORT OUT VII and IX trials In addition to the data provided by the BIOFLOW studies, several large-scale investigator-initiated trials demonstrating the safety and efﬁ- cacy of the Orsiro BP-SES have also emerged. Fig. 3 shows rates of TLF at 12 months from selected prospective randomized controlled trials com- paring the Orsiro BP-SES with the Xience PP-EES. The BIOSCIENCE [1] trial, published in 2014, was similar to BIOFLOW II in design and was a large scale, 1:1 randomized noninfe- riority trial. Unlike BIOFLOW II, however, patients with acute coro- nary syndrome in the preceding 72 h were included. Patient enrollment was completed in 12 months, with 2119 patients and 3139 lesions enrolled. The primary endpoint of TLF at 12 months showed that Orsiro BP-SES was non-inferior to Xience DP-EES (Orsiro 6.5% vs. Xience 6.6%, pnoninferiority b 0.0004), similar to the ﬁndings of BIOFLOW II. A novel ﬁnding, however, was the subgroup analysis in patients treated with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). In the prespeciﬁed subgroup of acute coronary syndromes with STEMI, the Orsiro BP-SES was associated with a lower risk of TLF than the Xience PP-EES at 12 months (Orsiro 3.3% vs. Xience 8.7%, p = 0.024) [1,20]. The BIOSCIENCE 5-year follow-up data [20] failed to show any difference in the TLF rate at 5 years between the two groups, suggesting that the reduction seen at 12 months may be related to the BP-SES's ultrathin struts, and that after complete 541 B.J. Forrestal et al. / Cardiovascular Revascularization Medicine 21 (2020) 540–548breakdown of the biodegradable polymer, the risk of very late TLF is similar to that observed with permanent-polymer stents. One question that remained after the publication of the early BIOFLOW trials and the BIOSCIENCE trial was whether the low rates of TLF observed with the Orsiro BP-SES were due to the thin strut design and the absence of a permanent-polymer stent within the vessel wall, re- ducing vascular inﬂammation and the development of neoatherosclerosis. The BIO-RESORT [21] study aimed to answer this question using a large-scale, multicenter three-arm randomized control trial. The 3514 patients who were enrolled included all-comers and acute coronary syndromes with minimal exclusion factors and random- ized patients to receive one of three stents.

Over 12 months, the Orsiro BP-SES proved to be noninferior to the durable-polymer Resolute Integrity stents and had similar rates of TVF as the Synergy BP-EES [21,22]. Follow-up data at 2 years showed that TVF was not statistically dif- ferent between the three stents; however, when TLF was examined using a landmark analysis between 12 and 24 months, Orsiro BP-SES fared better than Resolute, with a target vessel revascularization (TVR) rate of 0.6% for Orsiro compared with 1.5% for Resolute, suggesting that Orsiro BP-SES reduced the risk of revascularization after 1 year of follow-up [22]. Based on the rates of TLF seen in the BIOFLOW V [2] and BIO-RESORT [21,22] studies, the Orsiro BP-SES was selected as the comparator for the ﬁrst randomized controlled trial of the newly designed Resolute Onyx stent (Medtronic, Santa Rosa, California, USA) in the BIONYX trial [23]. Resolute Onyx was developed as a thin-strut durable-polymer zotarolimus-eluting stent system. The trial included all comers, ran- domizing 2516 patients in a 1:1 fashion. Both stents showed excellent safety and efﬁcacy, with low rates of deﬁnite or probable stent thrombo- sis in both groups (Orsiro 0.7% vs. Onyx 0.1%, hazard ratio 0.11 [95% CI 0.01–0.87]; p = 0.0112). The primary endpoint of TLF at 12 months was similar in both the Orsiro BP-SES and Onyx groups [23]. Funding has been secured for up to three years of follow-up, with two-year data expected in the coming months. Whereas the BIOFLOW, BIO-RESORT, BIOSCIENCE, and BIONYX trials compared Orsiro BP-SES to durable-polymer systems, the SORT OUT VII trial [24] was the ﬁrst head-to-head trial against a biodegradable- polymer system. The registry-based, multicenter, noninferiority trial randomized patients to receive the Orsiro BP-SES or the Nobori (stain- less-steel, biolimus-eluting, 120-μm strut) stent. The trial enrolled 2525 patients, with TLF at 12 months being the primary endpoint. Orsiro BP-SES was shown to be noninferior to Nobori at 12 months with re- spect to TLF (Orsiro 3.8% vs. Nobori 4.6%, 95% CI 0.12–0.92; pnoninferiority = 0.034). The rates of reported TLF were most likely lower than re- ported in the large BIOSCIENCE trial (6.5%), as the SORT OUT (3.8%) trial excluded procedure-related MI because of the registry-based de- sign. In addition, the Orsiro BP-SES demonstrated a statistically lower rate of deﬁnite of probable stent thrombosis at 12 months (Orsiro 0.4% vs. Nobori 1.2%, p = 0.03) [24]. Further studies against polymer-free drug-coated stents, such as the SORT OUT IX [25] trial, showed that the biolimus-based BioFreedom stent failed to meet the criteria for noninferiority of TLF at 12 months compared with Orsiro BP-SES, likely driven by a lower rate of target lesion revascularization (TLR) in the Orsiro BP-SES arm of the study [26]. Recent meta-analyses have suggested that the improved rates of TLF may be re- lated to an increased risk of stent thrombosis in thick-strut platforms such as 120-μm Nobori and 120-μm BioFreedom stents compared with the 60- μm Orsiro BP-SES system [27–29]. Data provided by the Swedish Coronary Angiography and Angioplasty Registry (SCAAR) corroborate the results seen in randomized trials. An analysis over the 6-year period from October 2011 to June 2017 including 74,131 patients (4561 in the Orsiro group compared to 69,570 who re- ceived other frequently used DES) showed signiﬁcantly lower rates of TLR in the Orsiro group (Orsiro 1.6% vs. other DES 2.3%, adjusted HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.60–0.94; p = 0.012) [30]. 2.3. Evidence in high-risk subgroups PCI in high-risk subgroups can present several challenging patient and lesion characteristics and can result in increased rates of in-stent re- stenosis, TVF, and stent thrombosis. The following section will address the performance of the Orsiro BP-SES in these high-risk subgroups. 2.3.1. ST-elevation myocardial infarction Patients presenting with STEMI pose several challenges to PCI. Malapposition of stent struts may result from undersizing and subse- quent thrombus resolution, setting the stage for an increased risk of early stent thrombosis [31]. Although the development of DES allowed for substantial improvements in early stent thrombosis, concerns remained about delayed vascular healing due to hypersensitivity and inﬂammation induced by permanent-polymer stents [32,33]. The thin- strut proﬁle coupled with the inert silicon carbide coating of the Orsiro BP-SES has shown promise in reducing rates of TLF, based on subgroup analyses in larger recent trials [2,20,31,34]. The BIOSCIENCE trial's 12- and 24-month [1,22] results demon- strated improved outcomes in STEMI patients. Twelve-month rates of TLF were reported at 3.3% vs. 8.7% in the BP-SES and DP-EES groups (risk ratio [RR] 0.38, p = 0.024) with 24-month data showing rates of 5.4% vs 10.8% (RR 0.48, p = 0.043) [32]. Most notably, the lower observed rates of TLF appeared to be driven by decreased rates of cardiac death or MI in the BP-SES group (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.21–1.02, p = 0.05) [32]. BIOFLOW V data showed a similar reduc- tion in TLF with a reported hazard ratio of 0.50 (95% CI 0.28–0.89) compared to DP-EES [2]. The combined results of the BIOFLOW V and BIOSCIENCE noninferi- ority trials and the demonstrated improved outcomes led to the design of the BIOSTEMI trial [35]. The trial enrolled 1300 patients presenting with STEMI with 1:1 randomization to the BP-SES or DP-EES treatment group. Unlike previous trials powered for noninferiority, BIOSTEMI demonstrated, for the ﬁrst time, clear superiority with respect to rates of TLF at 12 months in patients presenting with STEMI (Orsiro 4% vs. Xience 6%, rate ratio 0.59, posterior probability of superiority 0.986) [36]. The difference in the rates of TLF was driven primarily by fewer cases of clinically indicated TLR in the Orsiro group.

Chronic total occlusions Chronic total occlusions (CTOs) present one of the toughest envi- ronments for stent performance with respect to in-stent thrombosis and late or very late in-stent restenosis [37,38]. When compared to de novo lesions, CTOs are typically longer and more calciﬁed, often require multiple stents with overlapping segments, and may un- dergo late vessel remodeling as blood ﬂow increases, leading to va- sodilation and stent-strut malapposition, setting the stage for thrombosis or in-stent restenosis [39,40]. The PRISON IV [40] trial set out to evaluate the Orsiro BP-SES performance in this challenging population. Enrolling 330 patients, the trial randomized patients to receive Orsiro BP-SES or Xience in a 1:1 allocation. Of patients en- rolled in both arms of the trial, 99% underwent repeat angiography at 9 months and clinical follow-up at 12 months. PRISON IV failed to meet the primary endpoint of noninferior LLL at 9 months of Orsiro BP-SES compared with Xience and showed a signiﬁcantly higher rate of binary restenosis in the Orsiro BP-SES group (Orsiro 8.0% vs. Xience 2.1%, p = 0.028). The recent publication of the 3-year follow up data of the PRISION IV trial [41] gives the best long-term follow up of the Orsiro BP-SES's per- formance in CTOs. Over the three years of follow-up, the cumulative in- cidence of major adverse clinical events was higher in the Orsiro BP-SES arm than in the Xience EES arm (9.7% vs. 4.2%). Similar trends were also seen with respect to TLR over the study period favoring Xience with TLR rates reported as 9.7% in the Orsiro arm versus 3.4% in the Xience arm. A landmark analysis demonstrated that after one year, rates of TLR overall remained low but were higher in the Orsiro arm than in the Xience arm (2.1% vs. 0.6%, p-value reported as “NS”) [41]. In a smaller, non-randomized study, Markovic et al. [38] examined LLL at 9 months in patients receiving the Resolute Integrity zotarolimus- eluting stent versus the Orsiro BP-SES. Rates of LLL were signiﬁcantly less in the Orsiro BP-SES arm (Orsiro 0.24 ± 0.53 mm vs. Resolute Integ- rity 0.59 ± 0.72 mm, p = 0.01), but this did not translate into a difference in clinical events up to 24 months of follow-up. Although PRISON IV failed to show noninferiority with respect to LLL, the study was underpowered to detect clinical endpoints. The rates of TVR were higher in PRISON IV compared with BIOSCIENCE (9.2% vs. 4%), but this was probably due to the routine angiographic follow-up at 9 months in the PRISON IV trial as opposed to reported clin- ical events in the BIOSCIENCE trial. Subgroup analyses have demon- strated that the majority of the LLL seen within the PRISON IV study is due to stents with b3 mm in diameter (60-μm strut thickness) vs. stents N3 mm in diameter (80-μm strut thickness) [42]. An additional OCT sub- group analysis demonstrated favorable strut coverage in the Orsiro arm [43]. Despite these ﬁndings, results from CTO patients in BIOFLOW III [12,13] and SORT OUT VII [44] suggest that rates of TLF and TLR remain low in CTO subgroups. 2.3.3. Diabetes A recent meta-analysis pooling diabetic patients from the BIOFLOW II, IV, and V trials examined TLF at 1 year. The analysis included 494 di- abetic patients treated with Orsiro BP-SES and 263 patients treated with Xience across the three BIOFLOW trials. Rates of TLF were similar at one year: 6.3% in the Orsiro BP-SES group and 8.7% in the Xience group (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.047–1.43, p = 0.493) [16]. These ﬁndings were conﬁrmed in a subgroup analysis of the SORT OUT VII trial [45]. Rates of TLF among patients treated with or without insulin were also found to be similar [45]. 2.3.4. Small-vessel disease Small-vessel disease, generally deﬁned as vessels b2.75 mm in diameter, has been associated with a greater risk of TLR due to in- creased rates of in-stent restenosis [46,47]. Data from BIOFLOW II [10] and a subgroup analysis from BIO-RESORT [48] suggest that the ultrathin Orsiro BP-SES may provide additional beneﬁt in small-vessel subgroups. BIOFLOW II contained 259 patients within the small-vessel sub- group (≤2.75 mm) and demonstrated 5-year TLF rates of 11.1% in the BP-SES arm vs. 15.5% in the DP-EES arm (p = 0.303), a difference that was mainly due to a lower rate of death in the BP-SES arm (3.7% vs. 11.3%, p = 0.039) [10]. A subsequent analysis of the BIO-RESORT trial examined the 3-year outcomes in 1506 of the 3514 total trial participants. A multivariate analysis later showed that BP-SES was independently associated with lower rates of TLR at 3 years in com- parison with the everolimus and zotarolimus treatment groups (ad- justed HR 0.42, 95% CI 0.20–0.85, p = 0.02). No differences were reported in the rates of cardiac death, target vessel MI, or stent thrombosis at 3 years [48]. Results from the small-vessel cohort of the BIOSCIENCE trial [47] released in August 2019 differed somewhat from the results of the BIOFLOW II and BIO-RESORT small-vessel subgroups. The ≤2.75-mm small-vessel cutoff used in BIOFLOW II and BIO- RESORT, versus the deﬁnition of ≤3 mm or N 3 mm to deﬁne small- versus large-vessel disease used in BIOSCIENCE, potentially accounts for the discrepant results. Five-year rates of TLF were not found to be signiﬁcantly different between the BP-SES and DP-EES groups (22.3% vs. 18.3%, respectively; rate ratio 1.22, 95% CI 0.94–1.58, p = 0.13) [47]. Fig. 3.

Forrestal et al. / Cardiovascular Revascularization Medicine 21 (2020) 540–5482.3.5. In-stent restenosis Despite recent advances in stent technology, neoatherosclerosis due to inﬂammation, drug toxicity, and delayed vascular healing can result in revascularization rates of up to 10% [4,49]. The inert sil- icon carbide proBIO layer has the potential to improve biocompati- bility at the vessel interface and to reduce the proliferation of tissue, which leads to in-stent restenosis. However, to date, there are limited available randomized data on the efﬁcacy of BP-SES ver- sus existing second-generation DES in treating in-stent restenosis, with only 10 patients within the all-comer BIOSCIENCE trial and 30 within BIO-RESORT. Current European guidelines advocate for the use of drug-coated balloons (DCBs) or DES in the treatment of in-stent restenosis, but there are limited data on the efﬁcacy of latest-generation stents [50]. The BIOLUX trial [49] aimed to address this gap, randomizing 229 pa- tients with in-stent restenosis in a 2:1 fashion to receive treatment with a butyryl trihexyl citrate (BTHC)-based paclitaxel DCB versus BP- SES. In-stent LLL at 6 months and TLF at 12 months were compared be- tween both groups. Over the study period, DCB proved noninferior to BP-SES, with LLL in DCB arm reported at 0.03 ± 0.40 mm and 0.20 ± 0.70 mm in the BP-SES arm (p = 0.40). Rates of TLF at 12 and 18 months were also similar, demonstrating that both options seem fea- sible and effective but that further studies are needed in this challenging cohort of patients [49]. 2.4. Economic impact In addition to the improved clinical outcomes demonstrated in the BIOFLOW V trial, recent economic modeling has also suggested possible economic beneﬁts [51]. Markov economic modeling has shown that the reduction in rates of TLR and target vessel MI resulted in a cumulative reduction of $2415 per patient over a 48-month period compared to Xience [52]. With rising healthcare costs, these savings are an important consideration, not only for individual patients and insurance payers, but also for healthcare policymakers [51]. While caution should be exercised in interpreting this single sub-analysis, healthcare spending in the US alone is projected to reach 20% of gross domestic product by 2025 [53], so the delivery of safe, clinically effective and potentially eco- nomically viable treatments is an important consideration for any healthcare system. 3. Limitations The Orsiro BP-SES does have some notable limitations. The presence of the ultrathin struts may make the stent a less favorable choice in sit- uations requiring high radial force to prevent vessels recoil, such as CTOs, as described in a previous section. Additionally, data on the per- formance of the Orsiro BP-SES in heavily calciﬁed lesions is limited, mainly arising from small subgroups of “all-comers” trials, making any deﬁnite statements about the device's performance in this space difﬁcult. On a practical level, the ultrathin-stent struts can be difﬁcult to visu- alize using ﬂuoroscopy, so careful conﬁrmation of the stent position should be performed before deployment. 4. Future directions Several ongoing trials are continuing to investigate the efﬁcacy and effectiveness of the Orsiro BP-SES in comparison to other contemporary stents. The enhanced biocompatibility and ultrathin-strut design may also have a role to play in high-bleeding-risk populations by allowing for shortened dual antiplatelet therapy duration, which will be exam- ined in the planned BIOFLOW-DAPT study. With the favorable outcomes of the Orsiro BP-SES, ongoing developments in stent technology, such as the incorporation of CD34+ antibodies into bioabsorbable-polymer stents (COMBO™, OrbusNeich, Hoevalaken, the Netherlands), aimed at encouraging endothelial progenitor cell growth and vascular healing, are now being compared to the Orsiro BP-SES [54]. 5. Conclusions Overall, the Orsiro BP-SES has demonstrated its safety and nonin- feriority in numerous randomized clinical trials [1,3,14,20,48]. The combination of the ultrathin-strut design and inert proBIO silicon carbide layer allowing enhanced biocompatibility has demonstrated low rates of TLR against comparators and low rates of stent thrombo- sis. In speciﬁc high-risk subgroups, such as patients with STEMI and CTOs, notable exceptions have emerged, with lower rates of cardiac death and MI in STEMI patients [36], yet higher rates of TLR and major adverse cardiac events suggested in patients with CTOs [41]. Additional appropriately powered randomized controlled studies are needed to examine the role of the Orsiro BP-SES in other high- risk subgroups, including high-bleeding-risk patients, CTOs, and in- stent restenosis.
