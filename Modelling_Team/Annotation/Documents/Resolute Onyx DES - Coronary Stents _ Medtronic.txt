Resolute Onyx DES (https://ww w.medtronic .com/me- en/index.ht ml) Resolute Onyx DES for coronary artery disease Resolute Onyx™ is a drug-eluting stent (DES) that's different by design, optimised for complex PCI, and proven safe and effective in real-world, high bleeding risk patients on 1-month dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT).1 DOWNLOAD BROCHURE(OPENS NEW WINDOW) (/CONTENT/DAM/MEDTRONIC- COM/XD- EN/HCP/DOCUMENTS/DIGITALHUB/CARDIOVASCULAR/CORONARY/CORONARY- STENTS/RESOLUTE-ONYX-PRODUCT-BROCHURE.PDF) OVERVIEW PRODUCT FEATURES Best-in-class deliverability Single-wire design Resolute Onyx DES is made from a single wire, which gives it a fluid range of motion and provides the flexibility needed for best-in-class deliverability.2 Resolute Onyx DES is different by design to address your DES needs and a wide range of patient anatomies. It features: Best-in-class deliverability2 Enhanced visibility with thinner struts2 Smooth side branch access2 Fast healing3 The broadest diameter rangeSinusoid-formed wire Helical wrap Laser-fused Competitive comparison Resolute Onyx DES is more deliverable than laser-cut SYNERGY™* XD and XIENCE Skypoint™*, which are stiffer. Deliverability comparison — 3.0 mm DES2 (Lower is better) THE ONLY DES DESIGNED FROM A SINGLE WIRE‡ Proven components for optimal healing Watch a short video to learn more about the BioLinx™ polymer. Single-wire design provides a fluid range of motion and the conformability needed for superior strut apposition.2 BioLinx biocompatible polymer provides superior thromboresistance.4 When combined, fast healing occurs as evidenced by nearly 90% strut coverage at 30 days,3 providing the foundation for the Onyx ONE Global Trial. The Onyx ONE Global Trial analysed real-world, high bleeding risk patients on 1-month DAPT treated with a Resolute Onyx DES or a BioFreedom™* DCS.Results showed Resolute Onyx DES was safe and effective,1 providing the option to shorten DAPT in patients who are at high bleeding risk. Based on these results, Resolute Onyx DES was the first DES CE-indicated for HBR patients on 1-month DAPT.

Cobalt alloy shell 2. Platinum iridium core Resolute Onyx cobalt alloy shell and platinum-iridum core Smooth side branch access Resolute Onyx DES has round struts to create a smooth passage when accessing the side branch and lower the propensity to catch during bifurcation procedures.2 Strut comparison Rounded strut cross-section 1.

Resolute Onyx is the only DES with diameters ranging from 2.0 mm to 5.0 mm to treat a broad range of coronary vessel sizes.
